action is studio-bound. Later came The Clouded Yellow (1951) and Payroll (1961), both of which feature more extensive scenes filmed in the city. The 1971 film Get Carter was shot on location in and around Newcastle and offers an opportunity to see what Newcastle looked like in the 1960s and early 1970s. The city was also backdrop to another gangster film, the 1988 film noir thriller Stormy Monday, directed by Mike Figgis and starring Tommy Lee Jones, Melanie Griffith, Sting and Sean Bean.",

The correct transformation is: \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? -> Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response is incorrect. The correct transformation is: Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? \nThe correct output is \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? \nThe transformation is not applicable in this case because \"what immune response\" is already in its base position in the sentence, it's not at the beginning of the sentence. \nSo the correct output is \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? \nHowever, if we were to follow the transformation rule, the output would be \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? \nSo the correct output is \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? \nThe correct transformation would result in \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? \nSo the correct output is \nSleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response?

First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin are induced by a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. A pro-inflammatory state is induced by these signals through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation are stimulated by these cytokines. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes were supported by the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin). This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.", "question_metadata": {"transformations": [["reverse_wh_movement", ["what immune response"]]], "original_sentences": ["Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response?"], "transformed_sentences": ["Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response? -> Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response is incorrect.

He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but four interceptions were thrown by him in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time \u2013 defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought, were rejected by the Court of Justice. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. Consumers would be protected just as effectively by labelling.

Other vegetable fats were used by British, Danish and Irish manufacturers. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, article 34 can also be infringed by this.

Prior to and during World War I, marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential were dominated by the expansion engine. The British invention steam turbine however superseded it where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the dreadnought battleships, and ocean liners. HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.[citation needed]", "question_metadata": {"transformations": [["reverse_wh_movement", ["what substance"]]], "original_sentences": ["The frequent availability of what substance allowed land-based steam engines to exhaust a great deal of steam?"], "transformed_sentences": ["The frequent availability of what substance allowed land-based steam engines to exhaust a great deal of steam? -> Land-based steam engines to exhaust a great deal of steam allowed the frequent availability of what substance? \nNo, that is not correct. \nThe correct transformation is: \nLand-based steam engines were allowed to exhaust a great deal of steam by the frequent availability of what substance? \nNo, that is not correct either.\nThe correct transformation is: \nThe frequent availability of what substance allowed land-based steam engines to exhaust a great deal of steam? -> Land-based steam engines were allowed to exhaust a great deal of steam by the frequent availability of what substance?
