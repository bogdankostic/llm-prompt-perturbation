Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth. This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus a force will be experienced by an object that has a mass of", "For a long time, it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.", "are prime for any natural number n. Here  represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question. The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n \u2212 2, for any natural number n > 3. However, it requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with, computing A or \u03bc.

An example would be WBAI's broadcasting the track \"Filthy Words\" from a George Carlin comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending the Lebanon, New Hampshire city councilors an email stating, \"Wise up or die.\"", "In Marxian analysis, capital equipment is increasingly substituted for labor inputs (workers) by capitalist firms under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits. Over the long-term, the organic composition of capital is increased by this trend, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the \"reserve army of labour\"). A downward pressure on wages is exerted by this process. The productivity of each worker is raised by the substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation), resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.", "The communist authorities did not restore exceptional examples of the bourgeois architecture of the later periods after the war (like mentioned Kronenberg Palace and Insurance Company Rosja building) or they rebuilt them in socialist realism style (like Warsaw Philharmony edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris).

A correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom has been found by recent research. Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.", "The Standard Industrial Classification and the newer North American Industry Classification System have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction. To recognize the differences of companies in this sector, it is divided into three subsectors: building construction, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors.

Independence was briefly achieved for the French church by the Gallicans, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, his French translation of the New Testament was published by Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. A French Bible was published for them by Olivetan. A decidedly Calvinistic influence is shown by the French Confession of 1559. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.[citation needed]", "The concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples. It was believed that a certain person's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination. For example, people living in tropical environments were seen as \"less civilized\" therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission. Across the three waves of European colonialism (first in the Americas, second in Asia and lastly in Africa), environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. Two forms, orientalism and tropicality, are taken by this.", "A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.", "The principles of European Union law are rules of law which have been developed by the European Court of Justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how European Union law is interpreted and applies.

Fundamental rights ( see human rights ) , proportionality , legal certainty , equality before the law and subsidiarity are included by accepted general principles of European Union Law.", "During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin. Within the last 5\u201310 million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic.", "The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving both inputs of the multiplication algorithm the same input. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.", "The BBC National Orchestra of Wales has performed all the incidental music for the 2005 revived series from the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\" onwards, which has been composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster. Place was taken by a concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. The event was hosted by David Tennant, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms. Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time were performed by the BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir.

The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. Almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time are contained by the sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, the geological history of an area is provided with a guide to understanding by these concepts.", "Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science.

Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment and optimization.", "Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection. The symptoms of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells, produce inflammation. Prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes) are included by eicosanoids. Interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell, are included by common cytokines. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released.

He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" His findings were published by Priestley in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.", "In 1968, advantage was taken of new FCC ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide by ABC in order to purchase Houston radio stations KXYZ and KXYZ-FM for $1 million in shares and $1.5 million in bonds. That year, Roone Arledge was named president of ABC Sports; ABC Pictures, a film production company which released its first picture that year, the Ralph Nelson-directed Charly was founded by the company. It was renamed ABC Motion Pictures in 1979; the unit was dissolved in 1985. Two subsidiaries, Palomar Pictures International and Selmur Pictures, were also operated by the studio. In July 1968, ABC continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of ABC Marine World in Redwood City, California; that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986, with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of Oracle Corporation.", "A semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSh) marks Fresno, with mild, moist winters and hot and dry summers, thus displaying Mediterranean characteristics. December and January are the coldest months, and average around 46.5 \u00b0F (8.1 \u00b0C), and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually, with the coldest night of the year typically bottoming out below 30 \u00b0F (\u22121.1 \u00b0C). July is the warmest month, averaging 83.0 \u00b0F (28.3 \u00b0C); normally, there are 32 days of 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C)+ highs and 106 days of 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C)+ highs, and in July and August, there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C). Summers provide considerable sunshine, with July peaking at 97 percent of the total possible sunlight hours; conversely, January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of thick tule fog. However, 81% of possible sunshine is averaged by the year, for a total of 3550 hours. Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1 mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert. Most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest, as winds are driven downward along the axis of the California Central Valley; in December, January and February there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics.

This revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city. In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. Industrial structures that included the 2 1\u20442-mile (4.0 km) Victoria Tunnelling, built in 1842, which provided underground wagon ways to the staithes, were brought by the Victorian industrial revolution. On 3 February 1879, Mosley Street in the city, was the first public road in the world to be lit up by the incandescent lightbulb. Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting. The development of safety lamps, Stephenson's Rocket, Lord Armstrong's artillery, Be-Ro flour, Joseph Swan's electric light bulbs, and Charles Parsons' invention of the steam turbine, which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity, was included by innovations in Newcastle and surrounding areas. In 1882, Newcastle became the seat of an Anglican diocese, with St. Nicholas' Church becoming its cathedral.", "One of the most dramatic parts of the museum is the Cast Courts in the sculpture wing, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs.

One of the roles of the companion is to remind the Doctor of his \"moral duty\". The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning) were included by notable companions from the earlier series. Dramatically, a figure with whom the audience can identify is provided by these characters, and serves to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. New causes \u2014 or loves \u2014 are regularly found by them on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series.

The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256. He died in 1259 without a successor. The Song was returned from by Kublai in 1260 when he learned that his brother, Ariq B\u00f6ke, was challenging his claim to the throne. A kurultai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan was convened by Kublai. A rival kurultai in Mongolia proclaimed Ariq B\u00f6ke Great Khan, beginning a civil war. Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources. The Chinese era name of Zhongtong was bolstered by him among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting it. Inadequate supplies hampered Ariq B\u00f6ke and he surrendered in 1264. All of the three western khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate) became functionally autonomous, although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai as Great Khan. The Mongol Empire had been permanently divided by civil strife.", "Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career, though only a few of his works dealt with them directly. A theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ was reflected by him, but Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, kindness toward the Jews was advised by Luther in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them. In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews \"unraveled along with his health.\"", "While many United Methodist congregations operate in the evangelical tradition, the mainline Protestant traditions are reflected by others. Although United Methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time, these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church's founders, especially John Wesley and Charles Wesley (Anglicans), but also Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm (United Brethren), and Jacob Albright (Evangelical Association). With the formation of The United Methodist Church in 1968, the team which systematized denominational doctrine was led by theologian Albert C. Outler. Outler's work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.", "A modern example of school discipline in North America and Western Europe relies upon the idea of an assertive teacher who is prepared to impose their will upon a class. Positive reinforcement is balanced with immediate and fair punishment for misbehavior and firm, clear boundaries define what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Teachers are expected to respect their students; sarcasm and attempts to humiliate pupils are seen as falling outside of what constitutes reasonable discipline.[verification needed]", "In 1899, $100,000 was invested by John Jacob Astor IV for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system.

To function properly, they must be detected by an immune system, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguished from the organism's own healthy tissue, where \"they\" refers to a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the peripheral immune system is separated from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain by the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers.", "Plants have two main immune responses\u2014the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence. Their photosynthetic system is purposely damaged by chloroplasts, producing reactive oxygen species. The hypersensitive response will be caused by high levels of reactive oxygen species. Any pathogens within the cell are also directly killed by the reactive oxygen species. Systemic acquired resistance is initiated by lower levels of reactive oxygen species, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.", "The U.S. government has engaged in efforts to counter Islamism, or violent Islamism, since 2001. These efforts were centred in the U.S. around public diplomacy programmes conducted by the State Department. There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Islamism and jihadism. Christian Whiton, an official in the George W. Bush administration, called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of \"political warfare\" aimed at undermining the ideology. Something similar to the defunct U.S. Information Agency, which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War, was called for by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates.", "Early in 1537, a sermon in which he claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral law (the Ten Commandments), revealed God's wrath to Christians was preached by Johannes Agricola (1494\u20131566) \u2013 serving at the time as pastor in Luther's birthplace, Eisleben. Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg. These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall. Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540. He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 open letter to C. G\u00fcttel Against the Antinomians, and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.", "Recently, attention has been caught by chloroplasts. Pollen cannot disseminate transgenes in these plastids. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.", "A constitutional change was considered that would eliminate the position of Prime Minister and simultaneously reduce the powers of the President.

Jim Duffy stepped down as ABC Television president for a management position at ABC Communications, a subsidiary that specialized in community service programming, including shows related to literary education.", "According to economists David Castells-Quintana and Vicente Royuela, economic growth is harmed by increasing inequality. High and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth. Growth can be harmed by unemployment not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Economic growth is supported by policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects.", "In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that \"multiple acts\" would perform during the halftime show.

Normally, NADP+ takes the reenergized electrons, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants, which need more ATP than NADPH.", "Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to stay within the Church of England, the Methodists in the American colonies were decisively separated from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church by the American Revolution. In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, fellow priest Thomas Coke was decisively appointed as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society by Wesley. Together with Coke, a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church, was sent by Wesley.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and his own patented AC system was used by Westinghouse to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the engineers needed to build it were meant to be hired by the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring them, which meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. AC development was pursued by Thomas Edison in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.", "The rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed. A key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea, was occupied by the island. Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the Knights Templar and Guy de Lusignan subsequently acquired it, in 1192, and it became a stable feudal kingdom.

Nevertheless, a few other Yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities; an example is Tugh Temur (Emperor Wenzong), who wrote poetry, painted, read Chinese classical texts, and ordered the compilation of books.", "The second main legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states. A \"European Council\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities' is also convened by the heads of government of member states. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. Around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes is defined by this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means by this.

According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000, growth in richer countries is encouraged by high levels of inequality in relatively poor countries but reduce is not applicable here as the original sentence states 'reduce growth in relatively poor countries', so the correct transformation for the given patient is: According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000, growth in richer countries is encouraged by high levels of inequality. A positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less, but no correlation after ten years was found by a study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000. No correlations for any fixed lead time, and a negative impact on the duration of growth have been found by studies of larger data sets.", "In this work, one of his most emphatic statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin. All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just.

Sins will be committed by us while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides.", "Around 1800 Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure steam; his high-pressure engine patent was obtained by Trevithick in 1802. These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications. Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.", "The political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control is not the patient in this sentence, it's part of a clause describing what imperialism and colonialism dictate. \n\nThe meal example is a simple sentence with a clear agent and patient, but the given sentence is more complex. \n\nHowever, if we consider \"the difference between the two\" as the patient, the output would be:\nThe difference between the two is sometimes found difficult to illustrate by scholars. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.", "A variety of different illegal acts have been chosen by civil disobedients. Bedau writes, \"There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...Such acts are laid open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity by the remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law. Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. A desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) is directly achieved by some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, while openly breaking the law.

A set speed could not actually be held by the governor, because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.", "Numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach, were undergone by the Denver Broncos. His worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 was had by Manning. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, the NFL was led in interceptions by Manning. In week 10, a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot was suffered by Manning. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but four interceptions were thrown by him in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, number one was ranked by the team in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, home-field advantage was earned by the Broncos throughout the AFC playoffs, and the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record.", "The United Methodist Church is organized into conferences.

Growth as well as income inequality is increased and then decreased by increases in education, however, Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education. As a result, much lower wages are generally received by those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, growth is promoted by education because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.", "Centre for Contemporary Art is currently housed by the 17th century Royal Ujazd\u00f3w Castle, with some permanent and temporary exhibitions, concerts, shows and creative workshops.

Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave\u2013particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.[Note 4]", "The historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its \"duty\". Watt first introduced the concept of duty in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs. Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. This was improved to 65 million by early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam.", "With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves.", "The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals.

After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the infected corpses were catapulted over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants by the army. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north. Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.", "Numerous records from individuals and teams were featured by Super Bowl 50. Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and first downs (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team. The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl, and less than 200 yards had been gained by all of them. A Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX was tied by the Broncos' seven sacks. A Super Bowl record was tied by Kony Ealy. A new record was set by Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl.

A rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections, is possessed by even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. Phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system are included by these mechanisms. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Immunological memory is created by adaptive (or acquired) immunity after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.", "The European Court of Justice has recognised proportionality as one of the general principles of European Union law since the 1950s.

He was installed as the emperor (Emperor Wenzong) in Khanbaliq, while Yes\u00fcn Tem\u00fcr's son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support of Yes\u00fcn Tem\u00fcr's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah. The civil war against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals was eventually won by Khanbaliq-based Tugh Tem\u00fcr, gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty. Afterwards, Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him was announced by Tugh Tem\u00fcr, who abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Tem\u00fcr. El Tem\u00fcr supposedly killed him with poison, and Tugh Tem\u00fcr then remounted the throne. Tugh Tem\u00fcr also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Tem\u00fcr during his latter three-year reign. Power was brought to warlords by El Tem\u00fcr.", "The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers. The Green Dining Room 1866\u201368 was the work of Philip Webb and William Morris, and displays Elizabethan influences. The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens, the walls and even the Ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, The Centre Refreshment Room 1865\u201377 was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble, and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room 1876\u201381 was designed by Sir Edward Poynter, the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum, the windows are also stained glass, there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.", "Following the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66\u201334 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, a relatively narrow band was spanned by the rainforest. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.", "Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, in other words there is no distinctive larval form, and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults. In the genus Beroe tentacles and tentacle sheaths are lacked by the juveniles, like the adults. In most species the body forms of their parents are gradually developed by the juveniles. In some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to the sea-floor.", "In August 1227, during the fall of Yinchuan, the capital of Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle. According to The Secret History of the Mongols Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury. He was already old and tired from his journeys. The Galician\u2013Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Genghis' death is connected with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty by later Mongol chronicles. The legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him was related by one chronicle from the early 17th century, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.", "The contract to build the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA was won by North American Aviation. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.", "Following the treaty, the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations, was issued by King George III on October 7, 1763. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. Provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians were contained by the proclamation. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery\"; French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution, was maintained by the Act.", "Other senior pharmacy technicians supervise and manage a Pharmacy Technician in the UK. In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register. The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.", "Teaching may be carried out informally, within the family, which is called homeschooling, or in the wider community.

A general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network was described by Report P-2626. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.", "For many years, Sudan had an Islamist regime under the leadership of Hassan al-Turabi. Influence was first gained by his National Islamic Front when strongman General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979. A powerful economic base was built by Turabi with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia. Sympathetic students were placed in the university and military academy by him while he was serving as minister of education.", "One computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100. However, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.", "The arrival times of seismic waves can be used by seismologists in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. The existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core was showed by early advances in this field. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. The simplified layered model has been replaced by these images with a much more dynamic model.", "A revised version of the ABC logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013\u201314 season during the network's upfront presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially introduced on-air on June 17 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of an overhaul of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar. The updated logo carries a simpler gloss design than the previous version, and lettering more closely resembling Paul Rand's original version of the circle logo is contained by the updated logo. The logo is displayed on-air, online and in print advertising in four variants shading the respective color used with the circle design's native black coloring: a gold version is primarily used on entertainment-oriented outlets (such as ABC.com, WATCH ABC, and by ABC Studios) and the on-screen bug; steel blue and dark grey versions are used primarily by ABC News; a red version is used for ESPN on ABC, while all four variants are used selectively in advertising and by affiliates.

The treaty was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe. The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies in North America were turned over to a commission to resolve, but it reached no decision. Both sides claimed frontiers from between Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north, to the Ohio Country in the south.

A theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ was reflected by him, but Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, kindness toward the Jews was advised by Luther in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them. In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy, Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luther's attitude towards Jews \"unraveled along with his health.\"", "The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.

The Yuan dynasty is also known as the \"Mongol dynasty\" or \"Mongol Dynasty of China\", similar to the names \"Manchu dynasty\" or \"Manchu Dynasty of China\" for the Qing dynasty. Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the \"Empire of the Great Khan\" or \"Khanate of the Great Khan\", which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan.

Due to its central location between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Krak\u00f3w and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. The title of the \"Phoenix City\" was gained by Warsaw because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, painstaking rebuilding was required by the city after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).", "The majority of employment is constituted by service sectors including financial and property services, health, education, wholesale, retail, hospitality and manufacturing.

Many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all, may fill the role of \"spiritual teacher\". The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretatios of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home.

The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures, was independently discovered by Watt. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature. The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine to engineers.", "The Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play.

The formation of the grand coalition, in which the two political parties would share power equally, was brought by the deal, and the deal heralded it, but a more natural transformation would be: The deal brought Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM together and heralded the formation of the grand coalition, in which the two political parties would share power equally, can be transformed into: Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM were brought together by the deal, and the formation of the grand coalition, in which the two political parties would share power equally, was heralded by the deal.", "Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so more land is constantly being cleared by farmers and new areas are moved to. Extensive environmental damage was caused by these farming practices, which led to deforestation. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.", "On May 21, 2013, the game was voted and awarded to Levi's Stadium by NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014.

There was an attempt to withdraw the United Methodist Church membership in the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice at their General Conference, held in May 2012, with a petition that passed through the legislative subcommittee and committee votes, but was not given a floor vote. Rev. Paul T. Stallsworth, president of the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality said he \"had every reason to believe\" that pro-life delegates would have won a floor vote.", "The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I. The S-IV was replaced by the second stage with the S-IVB-200, powered by a single J-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce 200,000 lbf (890 kN) of thrust. A restartable version of the S-IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg) into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM.

Religious tolerance was practiced by the Mongol Empire because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.[citation needed] Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his mentor and eventual rival, had converted to Nestorian Christianity. Various Mongol tribes were Shamanist, Buddhist or Christian. Religious tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.", "The network was purchased for $8 million by Edward John Noble, the owner of Life Savers candy, drugstore chain Rexall and New York City radio station WMCA. Due to FCC ownership rules, the transaction, which was to include the purchase of three RCA stations by Noble, would require him to resell his station with the FCC's approval. The transaction was authorized by the Commission on October 12, 1943. Soon afterward, the new company Noble founded, the American Broadcasting System, purchased the Blue Network. The corporate name American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. was adopted by its parent company.

This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.", "Doctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, part of a story ( or \" serial \" ) \u2014 usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years was formed by each weekly episode. Notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, \"Mission to the Unknown\", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the 10-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23. A storyline occasionally loosely connected serials, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.", "A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.", "In August 1999, a special series event, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, a game show based on the British program of the same title, was premiered by ABC. Hosted throughout its ABC tenure by Regis Philbin, the program became a major ratings success throughout its initial summer run, which led ABC to renew Millionaire as a regular series, returning on January 18, 2000. At its peak, the program aired as much as six nights a week. Buoyed by Millionaire, during the 1999\u20132000 season, ABC became the first network to move from third to first place in the ratings during a single television season. The show was relaunched by Buena Vista Television as a syndicated program (under that incarnation's original host Meredith Vieira) in September of that year, after Millionaire ended its run on the network's primetime lineup after three years in 2002.", "This combination of cancellations and \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic ground state. An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen (see the filled \u03c0* orbitals in the diagram), orbitals that are of equal energy\u2014i.e., degenerate\u2014is a configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of the O\n2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.[b] The bond order is weakened by their filling from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; spontaneous combustion is prevented by this.", "Many Han Chinese and Khitan defected to the Mongols to fight against the Jin.

The school color is crimson, which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. An 1875 vote of the student body unofficially adopted the color (in preference to magenta), although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard's 21st and longest-serving president (1869\u20131909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.", "In addition to climate assessment reports, Special Reports on specific topics are being published by the IPCC.

In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs was published by the FCC in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, According to the FCC, NBC Blue was being used by RCA to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest was established by the FCC.", "Most species are hermaphrodites\u2014a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning both eggs and sperm can be produced by a single animal, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. Small populations are enabled to grow at an explosive rate by the combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction.", "Collaboration across multiple disciplines is required by large-scale construction. It is normally supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project manager, and the job is managed by an architect. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential. Zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction-site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc., must be considered by those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question. The largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects.", "The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator. Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower, is traced on paper by the steam engine indicator. Engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors routinely used it. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines.

These have now been removed to other areas of the museum. Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton: Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878\u20131880 and Industrial Arts Applied to Peace, which was started but never finished. To the east of this were additional galleries, the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones, these were the Oriental Courts (covering India, China and Japan) completed in 1863, none of this decoration survives, part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century, opened in December 2006.

F. W. Moody designed the ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings, and it has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864\u201369. Percival Ball flanked this with terracotta statue groups. Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range, was replaced by this building.", "There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-Additional metamorphism may also be undergone by metamorphic rock. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.", "The league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium and Levi's Stadium.

As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.", "Following the French Crown's revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants' settling in Ireland.

Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. The fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker, is exploited by this approach. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.", "The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. The town of Otrar was quickly seized by the Mongol army, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Molten silver was poured into his ears and eyes by Genghis Khan. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Subutai and Jebe were ordered by Genghis Khan to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this.

Bowman was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914. Three years later in 1917, he was appointed to then President Woodrow Wilson's inquiry in 1917. The inquiry was the idea of President Wilson and the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference.

This relationship was demonstrated by Kuznets using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] was not necessarily disproved by this.

However, the caravan that came from Mongolia was attacked by Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. A second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq was sent again by Genghis Khan. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons were planned by Genghis Khan. \u00d6gedei was likely appointed to be his immediate successor by him.", "Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The \"Hugues hypothesis\" argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. The Gallicans and Protestants regarded him as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.", "Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Rock units that are higher below those that are lower are dropped by normal faults. This typically results in younger units being placed below older units. Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for \"sausage\", because of their visual similarity.", "A passion for (and became very proficient at) billiards, chess and card-playing was developed by Tesla during his second year of study at Graz, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.:43, 301 On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.:208 Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. One morning was recalled by Swezey when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: \"I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, I was awakened by the telephone ring. The telephone was suddenly closed by him when he felt he had arrived at the solution.", "Luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin. Sacerdotalism was opposed by his theology by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with these, and all of Luther's wider teachings, are called Lutherans even though Luther insisted on Christian or Evangelical as the only acceptable names for individuals who professed Christ.", "After each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete. A few plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller knocked the ball out of Newton's hands while sacking him, and it was recovered by Malik Jackson in the end zone for a Broncos touchdown, giving the team a 10\u20130 lead.

For the top 21 industrialised countries, counting each person equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = -.907). A similar relationship exists among US states (r = -.620).", "Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that \"the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality,\" and consumption is more important than income. According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. Journalist Thomas B. Edsall summarizes the debate in \"The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor\". Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality, and the CBO's study found consumption data not \"adequately\" capturing \"consumption by high-income households\" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.", "Another important library \u2013 the University Library, founded in 1816, is home to over two million items.

Xiliang-fu[disambiguation needed] was taken by him. The Mongols were challenged to a battle near Helan Mountains by one of the Tangut generals but were defeated. In November, the Yellow River was crossed by Genghis, and he laid siege to the Tangut city Lingzhou, defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.", "In 1993, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules were repealed by the FCC, once again allowing networks to hold interests in television production studios. That same year, Capital Cities/ABC purchased the French animation studio DIC Entertainment; that same year, Capital Cities/ABC also signed an agreement with Time Warner Cable to carry its owned-and-operated television stations on the provider's systems in ABC O&O markets. By that year, ABC had a total viewership share of 23.63% of American households, just below the limit of 25% imposed by the FCC.", "It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force. However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons cannot be occupied by them. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.", "It was not until January 1518 that friends of Luther translated the 95 Theses from Latin into German and printed and widely copied them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press. Within two weeks, copies of the theses had spread throughout Germany; within two months, they had spread throughout Europe.", "There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent deglaciation. Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. How extensive was this reduction, however, over which there is debate? Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and the available data support both explanations reasonably well.", "With Istanbul as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries. Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century. The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of World War I, leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.", "In 1998, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white \"ABC Circle\" logo on a yellow background (a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup was featured by promotions during this time).

Like the helicosproidia, they're parasitic, and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast. They were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than chromalveolates. Plasmodium, the malaria parasite is included by the apicomplexans. A vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast, which they inherited from their ancestors, is kept by many apicomplexans. The chloroplast has been lost completely by other apicomplexans like Cryptosporidium. Their energy is stored in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm by apicomplexans, even though they are nonphotosynthetic.", "EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) agreement between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies were made by article 66. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The enactment of competition law was established by the Treaty of Rome as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. Provisions on state aid were made by article 92. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.", "On June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007\u201308 season, \"Start Here\". Also developed by Troika, the on-air design was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (in particular, using a system of icons representing different devices, such as television, computers and mobile devices), and \"simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC\". The ABC logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition, with a glossy \"ball\" effect that was specifically designed for HD. On-air, animated water and ribbon effects accompanied the logo. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.", "Several medals, six gold, four silver and four bronze, were won by Kenya during the Beijing Olympics, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. Attention was gained by new athletes, such as Pamela Jelimo, the women's 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the IAAF Golden League jackpot, and Samuel Wanjiru who won the men's marathon. Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty was helped usher in by retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kipchoge Keino in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion Henry Rono's spectacular string of world record performances. Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly Bahrain and Qatar. The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with Bernard Lagat the latest, choosing to represent the United States. Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors. Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.[citation needed]", "A structure called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum is contained by some chloroplasts. It is often found in the chloroplasts of C4 plants, though it has also been found in some C3 angiosperms, and even some gymnosperms. The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast. Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm. The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.", "Six soundtrack releases have been released since 2005.

The Mongols were not attacked by the commander of the Jin dynasty army at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent the Mongol side a messenger, Ming-Tan, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At this engagement fought at Badger Pass hundreds of thousands of Jin troops were massacred by the Mongols. In 1215 the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing) was besieged, captured, and sacked by Genghis. The Emperor Xuanzong was forced by this to move his capital south to Kaifeng, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols.

As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV was sold to Young Broadcasting for $387 million by Disney. On April 4, Disney sold Knight Ridder the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities for $1.65 billion. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with his place as president and CEO being taken by Robert Iger. Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block.

Tem\u00fcjin grew up observing the tough political climate of Mongolia, which included tribal warfare, thievery, raids, corruption, and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations, all compounded by interference from foreign forces such as the Chinese dynasties to the south. Many lessons about the unstable political climate of Mongolia, especially the need for alliances, were taught by Tem\u00fcjin's mother Hoelun.", "A philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology was provided by Aristotle. In Aristotle's view, four elements that come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein were contained by the terrestrial sphere. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. A continuum like air is demanded by this explanation for change of place in general.", "Katharina von Bora, one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523, when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels, was married by Martin Luther.

There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Many peasants were led to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general by Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with \"liberal\" phraseology. Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as M\u00fcntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.", "In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, this price drives inequality. Under the law of supply and demand, a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker determines the price of skill. On the other hand, workers and consumers can also be abused by markets, which can concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society. \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. The best of their labor will be taken advantage of by their competitors by offering a higher wage. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.", "In the Sandgate area, to the east of the city and beside the river, resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families.

Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the epidemic; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British City in this period.", "An animal phylum that is more complex than sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals) is formed by ctenophores. Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.", "The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. About 40% of Egypt's population was killed by the Black Death. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110\u2013120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and by 1450 reduced this by nearly 40,000. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and some areas were less vulnerable to contagion by the most isolated areas. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.", "In terms of housing stock, the authority is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached homes rise in the 2010 Census (to 7.8%), in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments to 25.6%, and the proportion of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five colour-coded brackets at 5.9%, and on a par with Oxford and Reading, greater than Manchester and Liverpool and below a handful of historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities: Harrogate, Cheltenham, Bath, inner London, Hastings, Brighton and Tunbridge Wells.", "Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee (\"upper lake\"), the Untersee (\"lower lake\"), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein (\"Lake Rhine\"). The lake is situated in Germany, Switzerland and Austria near the Alps.

Many, not least Melanchthon, who called it reckless, were surprised by his decision to marry. Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, \"I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic.\" Before marrying, Luther had been living on the plainest food, and, as he admitted himself, his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time.", "Luther and his wife moved into a former monastery, \"The Black Cloister,\" a wedding present from the new elector John the Steadfast (1525\u201332).

Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e. \"cultural revolution\", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric). Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc De\u00e1k directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing \"peaceable revolution.\" Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in The Declaration of Independence to \"alter or abolish\" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.

The presence of DNA/RNA with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences was assessed by them. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \". . . ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\".", "In 2000, a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called \"the dot\", in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to \"download the dot\", a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner was launched by ABC.

With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972 the triad was completed by connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network. The stage was set by all of this for Merit's role in the NSFNET project starting in the mid-1980s.", "Systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant are involved by many plant immune responses. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When a part of a plant becomes infected, a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant, is produced by the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.", "The city has an extensive neoclassical centre referred to as Tyneside Classical largely developed in the 1830s by Richard Grainger and John Dobson, and recently extensively restored. Grey Street is described as one of the finest streets in England by the late German-born British scholar of architecture, Nikolaus Pevsner. The street curves down from Grey's Monument towards the valley of the River Tyne and was voted England's finest street in 2005 in a survey of BBC Radio 4 listeners. In the Google Street View awards of 2010, Grey Street came 3rd in the British picturesque category. Osborne Road came 4th in the foodie street category. A portion of Grainger Town was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Eldon Square Shopping Centre, including all but one side of the original Eldon Square itself.", "Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: prestige and the social status of the 'old school tie'; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities (e.g. playing fields, swimming pools, etc.), higher-paid teachers; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education. The removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools, is offered by some schools. Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer. Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.[citation needed]", "There are several ways to mitigate the occupational hazards of teaching. Organizational interventions, like changing teachers' schedules, providing support networks and mentoring, changing the work environment, and offering promotions and bonuses, may be effective in helping to reduce occupational stress among teachers. Individual-level interventions, including stress-management training and counseling, are also used to relieve occupational stress among teachers.", "Additionally, multiple Doctors have returned in new adventures together in audio dramas based on the series.

In 2010, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy and Paul McGann came together again to star in the audio drama The Four Doctors.", "Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development. According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth. As a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality. Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.", "Since 1974, ABC has generally aired Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on New Year's Eve (hosted first by its creator Dick Clark, and later by his successor Ryan Seacrest); the only exception was in 1999, when ABC put it on a one-year hiatus to provide coverage of the international millennium festivities, though Clark's traditional countdown from Times Square was still featured within the coverage. The Miss America pageant has also been aired by ABC from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2005 (with the television rights being assumed by cable channel TLC in 2006, when the pageant moved from its longtime homebase in Atlantic City to Las Vegas, before returning to Atlantic City in 2013) and since 2011.

The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (w\u00fcstite) is written as Fe\n1 \u2212 xO, where x is usually around 0.05.", "Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-Rays\").

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. The Council must give authorisation for \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states. The Commission should inform member state governments at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

The GTCS gives \"Provisional Registration\" which is raised to \"Full Registration\" status after a year if there is sufficient evidence to show that the \"Standard for Full Registration\" has been met.", "There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation. Teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter. Enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the teacher's enthusiasm may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning. Also, enthusiasm may act as a \"motivational embellishment\"; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the enthusiastic teacher's presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion, may also apply. Students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the enthusiasm and energy of the teacher.[citation needed]", "The city developed around the Roman settlement Pons Aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, William the Conqueror's eldest son.

Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, this price drives inequality. Under the law of supply and demand, a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker determines the price of skill. On the other hand, workers and consumers can also be abused by markets, which can concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society. \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. The best of their labor will be taken advantage of by their competitors by offering a higher wage. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.", "To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities?

The IT industry magazine Computing voted Northumbria University 'Best New University' and also awarded it a much coveted company award of the \"Most IT enabled organisation\" (in the UK).", "The enforcement of the ban on the 95 Theses fell to the secular authorities. On 18 April 1521, Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms. This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms, a town on the Rhine. It was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with Emperor Charles V presiding. A safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting was obtained by Prince Frederick III, Elector of Saxony.", "Following the treaty, the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory, and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations, was issued by King George III on October 7, 1763. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. Provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians were contained by the proclamation. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery\"; French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution, was maintained by the Act.", "The largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market, which serve as repeaters of WBMA-LD (the largest low-power \"Big Four\" affiliate by market size, which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite WGWW, owned by Sinclair partner company Howard Stirk Holdings) is owned by Sinclair.

By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361\u201362, 1369, 1379\u201383, 1389\u201393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century.

Therefore, war is rejected by the Church as an instrument of national foreign policy, to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide, brutal suppression of human rights, and unprovoked international aggression. It insists that the first moral duty of all nations is to resolve by peaceful means every dispute that arises between or among them; that human values must outweigh military claims as governments determine their priorities; that the militarization of society must be challenged and stopped; that the manufacture, sale, and deployment of armaments must be reduced and controlled; and that the production, possession, or use of nuclear weapons be condemned.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty on climate change, is supported by reports that the IPCC produces. The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to \"stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-induced] interference with the climate system\".

It does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are, saying that a problem is not in P. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases.

Economist Branko Milanovic, wrote in 2001 that, \"The view that income inequality harms growth \u2013 or that improved equality can help sustain growth \u2013 has become more widely held in recent years. ... The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development. When physical capital mattered most, savings and investments were key. Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, a more \"social\" Europe was shifted towards by this focus. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, the right to residence in the Netherlands was claimed by a German man, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. It means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights having \"worker\" status. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, little impact of labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers is found by practically \"all available research\".", "Korean economist Hoesung Lee is the chair of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the election of the new IPCC Bureau.

The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost. The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).", "Religious texts such as the Quran, Torah or Bible may be taught by religious and spiritual teachers, such as gurus, mullahs, rabbis, pastors/youth pastors and lamas.", "Following guidelines set in the National Cycling strategy, its cycling strategy was first developed by Newcastle in 1998.

The body is generally patrolled by phagocytes searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Nutrients were acquired by phagocytosis as a means of acquiring them, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. The oldest form of host defense is probably represented by phagocytosis, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.", "Despite waiving longtime running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.

A general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network was described by Report P-2626. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.", "Luther's 1538 hymnic version of the Lord's Prayer, \"Vater unser im Himmelreich\", corresponds exactly to Luther's explanation of the prayer in the Small Catechism, with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas. Candidates were examined on specific catechism questions by the hymn as a means of examining them, while the hymn functioned as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer. Multiple revisions are shown by the extant manuscript, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune. Luther's tune has been adopted by other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord's Prayer, although modern texts are considerably shorter.", "During the 20th century, a framework for understanding European imperialism was constructed by historians John Gallagher (1919\u20131980) and Ronald Robinson (1920\u20131999). They claim that European imperialism was influential, and the notion that \"imperialism\" required formal, legal control by one government over another country was rejected by Europeans. In their view, formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red have mesmerized historians. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'\"[attribution needed] Because of the resources made available by imperialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.", "In the first half of the 17th century, some 1.7 million victims were claimed by a plague in Italy, or about 14% of the population. In 1656, about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants were killed by the plague. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain. The population of Seville was probably reduced by half by the plague of 1649. In 1709\u201313, about 100,000 were killed by a plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700\u201321, Sweden v. Russia and allies) in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki, and a third of Stockholm's population was claimed by the plague. Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in Marseille.", "One of the principal advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. Only 1% to 3% of the turbine power is consumed by the work required by the pump and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 \u00b0C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.[citation needed]", "It requires a post-secondary degree Bachelor's Degree teaching in Canada. In most provinces a second Bachelor's Degree such as a Bachelor of Education is required to become a qualified teacher. Salary ranges from $40,000/year to $90,000/yr. Teachers have the option to teach for a public school which is funded by the provincial government or teaching in a private school which is funded by the private sector, businesses and sponsors.", "Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.", "The objective is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to learning, including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills, knowledge and/or thinking skills. Different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy. When deciding what teaching method to use, students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority are considered by teachers. Many times, students are assisted in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying teachers on field trips. The increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade, has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom.", "One of the more unusual collections is that of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of Animal Locomotion of 1887, this consists of 781 plates. Images of different animals and humans performing various actions are captured by these sequences of photographs taken a fraction of a second apart. There are several of John Thomson's 1876-7 images of Street Life in London in the collection. James Lafayette's society portraits, a collection of more than 600 photographs dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries and portraying a wide range of society figures of the period, including bishops, generals, society ladies, Indian maharajas, Ethiopian rulers and other foreign leaders, actresses, people posing in their motor cars and a sequence of photographs recording the guests at the famous fancy-dress ball held at Devonshire House in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, are also held by the museum.", "It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity are utilized by many species. A unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system, is used by bacteria to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Acquired immunity is also possessed by prokaryotes, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.", "It goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical, using boiling water to produce mechanical motion. The first patent for a steam engine was obtained by the Spanish inventor Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont in 1606. In 1698 a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped was patented by Thomas Savery. Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water. Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in 1712 for pumping in a mine.", "It has won the Short Form of the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the oldest science fiction/fantasy award for films and series, six times (every year since 2006, except for 2009, 2013 and 2014).

Doctor Who has been nominated for over 200 awards and has won over a hundred of them.", "Before World War I, overseas investors were sought by Tesla. After the war started, the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries was lost by Tesla. Eventually, Wardenclyffe was sold for $20,000 ($472,500 in today's dollars) by him. In 1917, around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, AIEE's highest honor, the Edison Medal was received by Tesla.", "The year was finished by Manning with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4. The team was led by Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. A big impact was also made by running back Ronnie Hillman with 720 yards, five touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.7 yards per carry average. Overall, any Pro Bowl selections were not had by the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points.", "Rapid combustion is promoted by highly concentrated sources of oxygen. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion. Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire.", "If angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts. An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll, and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body. While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked. Within a few minutes of light exposure, the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced. Several hours are taken by this process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast. Light is not required by gymnosperms to form chloroplasts.", "Currently detention is one of the most common punishments in schools in the United States, the UK, Ireland, Singapore and other countries. It requires the pupil to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g. \"Saturday detention\" held at some schools. During detention, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a punishment essay, or sit quietly.", "Some 2% of its population is represented by approximately one million Protestants in modern France. Most are concentrated in Alsace in northeast France and the C\u00e9vennes mountain region in the south, who still regard themselves as Huguenots to this day.[citation needed] A diaspora of French Australians still considers itself Huguenot, even after centuries of exile. The Huguenot Society of Australia encourages it to embrace and conserve its cultural heritage, aided by the Society's genealogical research services.", "Firstly, certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.", "Luther's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors. The Apostles' Creed was expressed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language by them. Each article of the Creed was rewritten by him to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life. That is, the Trinity was depicted not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known by Luther. A divine unity with separate personalities is sanctified by the Spirit. The believer is drawn to the Father by salvation. Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and the Lord's Prayer, which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching.", "After leaving Edison's company, partnership was formed by Tesla with two businessmen in 1886, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an electric lighting company in Tesla's name, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. The company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by Tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.", "During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. AC power was found by him to be the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement it. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.", "Several major human spaceflight milestones were set by Apollo. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil were returned to Earth by the program, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. Construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center was funded by the program, and the program laid the foundation for NASA's current human spaceflight capability. Advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers, were spurred by Apollo.", "From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube was accepted as her Germanic frontier by Rome. Beyond these rivers only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads were held by her. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.", "A wide selection of serials are available from BBC Video on DVD, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States.

The profession has been avoided by several men who enjoy teaching. This has in some jurisdictions reportedly led to a shortage of male teachers.", "In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. The program was disliked by them, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.", "The area controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire was crossed by the Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons. After compiling intelligence from many sources his army, which was divided into three groups, was carefully prepared by Genghis Khan. The first division was led into the northeast of Khwarezmia by his son Jochi. The second division under Jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarzemia to form, with the first division, a pincer attack on Samarkand. Khwarzemia was attacked by the third division under Genghis Khan and Tolui from that direction.", "Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere is constituted by diatomic oxygen gas. However, a global downward trend is shown by monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.", "Despite the high position given to Muslims, some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely discriminated against them, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision, as well as Kosher butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding massacred the Muslims.", "Curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome\u2014most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway (though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway).", "Higher rates of health and social problems (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods (life expectancy by country, educational performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) have been found by British researchers Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in countries and states with higher inequality. Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, they found social/health problems lower in countries like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality, than in countries (US and UK) and states (Mississippi and New York) with large differences in household income.", "A semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSh) marks Fresno, with mild, moist winters and hot and dry summers, thus displaying Mediterranean characteristics.

Summers provide considerable sunshine, with July peaking at 97 percent of the total possible sunlight hours; conversely, January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of thick tule fog. However, 81% of possible sunshine is averaged by the year, for a total of 3550 hours. Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1 mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert.

In works such as La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme (1949\u201350), he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third \u00e9tude, \"Neumes rythmiques\". According to Messiaen, the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations inspired this way of composing.", "With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it, Newton did not and heavy criticism was later earned by his lack of aggression. Meanwhile, a new set of downs was given to the Broncos by a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and a pass to Bennie Fowler was completed by Manning for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24\u201310 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives, but failed to get a first down on each one.", "The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries. These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.Imperialism was supported by political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain. The discipline was dominated by these two arguments for decades while Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state\u2019s survival and Mackinder supported Britain\u2019s imperial expansion.", "In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. This work was refined by English chemist John Mayow (1641\u20131679) by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.", "In education, student learning is facilitated by teachers, often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors.

Evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s is presented by The BBC's Unnatural Histories. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox. Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0\u20131250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. Evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta was presented by the BBC's Unnatural Histories.", "In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973. Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that \"it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force.\" British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America \"might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries,\" and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned \"the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the \u2018total alienation\u2019 of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World.\"", "By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the U.S. and 3.5 million overseas.

The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately homes. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. William Stranahan mapped The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and it was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service was provided by developers Billings & Meyering, and the tract was acquired, street development was completed, and the property was begun to be marketed with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. The Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital, no doubt hastened this rapid development.", "In 1934, new stations were being established with difficulties by Mutual, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS, as a result of a complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties. In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs was published by the FCC in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, According to the FCC, NBC Blue was being used by RCA to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest was established by the FCC.", "In early 2009, ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios were merged into a new division, ABC Entertainment Group, which would be responsible for both its production and broadcasting operations, by Disney\u2013ABC Television Group. During this reorganization, the group announced that it would lay off 5% of its workforce. On April 2, 2009, Citadel Communications announced that it would rebrand ABC Radio as Citadel Media; however, ABC News continued to provide news content for Citadel. On December 22, a partnership with Apple Inc. to make individual episodes of ABC and Disney Channel programs available for purchase on iTunes was announced by Disney\u2013ABC Television Group.", "For some decades prior to the First Palestine Intifada in 1987, a \"quiescent\" stance towards Israel was taken by the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine, focusing on preaching, education and social services, and benefiting from Israel's \"indulgence\" to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations. As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the formation of HAMAS (\"zeal\"), devoted to Jihad against Israel, was announced by the Brotherhood. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, a more uncompromising stand was taken by the 1988 Hamas charter, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada. The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.", "In Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.", "Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space.\" He stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world. Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.:309", "The main provisions on equal treatment of workers are set out by the Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, equal treatment in respect of tax is required by article 7(2). In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement was rejected by the Court of Justice. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\" must be received by people, although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".", "In Berlin, two new neighbourhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt were created by the Huguenots. By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking. The French language was preserved by the Berlin Huguenots in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07. Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded, such as those of Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.", "Little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of motors and electrical transmission equipment was shown by the investors, and they also seemed to think it was better to develop an electrical utility than invent new systems. Tesla was eventually forced out by them, leaving him penniless. Control of the patents he had generated was lost by him. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and even as a ditch digger for $2 per day. The winter of 1886/1887 was considered as a time of \"terrible headaches and bitter tears\" by Tesla. During this time, the value of his education was questioned by him.", "The heavily built-up urban area stretching along the Pacific coast from Ventura, through the Greater Los Angeles Area and the Inland Empire, and down to Greater San Diego is included by Southern California. Seven metropolitan areas, or MSAs: the Los Angeles metropolitan area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange counties; the Inland Empire, consisting of Riverside and San Bernardino counties; the San Diego metropolitan area; the Oxnard\u2013Thousand Oaks\u2013Ventura metropolitan area; the Santa Barbara metro area; the San Luis Obispo metropolitan area; and the El Centro area, are encompassed by Southern California's population. Out of these, three are heavy populated areas: the Los Angeles area with over 12 million inhabitants, the Riverside-San Bernardino area with over four million inhabitants, and the San Diego area with over 3 million inhabitants. For CSA metropolitan purposes, the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura are all combined to make up the Greater Los Angeles Area with over 17.5 million people. Roughly 60 percent of California's population is contained by southern California.", "In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin are induced by a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. A pro-inflammatory state is induced by these signals through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation are stimulated by these cytokines. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes were supported by the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin). This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.", "The broadcast rights to the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards (which are rotated across all four major networks on a year-to-year basis), American Music Awards, Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade, Tournament of Roses Parade, Country Music Association Awards and the CMA Music Festival are currently held by ABC. Since 2000, the television rights to most of the Peanuts television specials have also been owned by ABC, having been acquired from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of A Charlie Brown Christmas (other Peanuts specials broadcast annually by ABC, including A Charlie Brown Christmas, include It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving).", "The University is organized into eleven separate academic units\u2014ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study\u2014with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's $37.6 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.", "A period of refurbishment and modernization, entitled 'Metro: All Change,' is currently undergoing by the system. Ticket gates have been introduced by the programme at the busiest stations - part of the transition to smart ticketing, and all ticket machines have been replaced by the programme. Improvement works (or in some cases complete reconstruction, for example North Shields) are being undergone by most stations. In addition; tracks, signalling and overhead wires are also being overhauled. The procurement of an entirely new fleet of trains and further extensions to the system is included by longer term plans. Proposed routes include to Newcastle's west end, to the Cobalt business park in North Tyneside, to the Metrocentre in Gateshead and to additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Trams as opposed to the current light rail trains would be required by several of the proposed routes.", "Genghis Khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in Mongolia's history. He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. Stability and unity were provided by him during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes, and many Mongol traditions were reinforced by him. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan\u2019s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. Genghis Khan is seen as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts by President Elbegdorj as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, he is seen as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country by Mongolians.", "Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther's letter containing the 95 Theses. He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome. The revenue from the indulgences was needed by him to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric. As Luther later noted, \"the pope had a finger in the pie as well, because one half was to go to the building of St Peter's Church in Rome\".", "Of particular concern with Internet pharmacies is the ease with which people, youth in particular, can obtain controlled substances (e.g., Vicodin, generically known as hydrocodone) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship. There are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a controlled substance to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.[citation needed] In the United States, in order for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship must issue it for a legitimate medical purpose. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship.", "Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The Monarch may vary the date of the poll by up to one month either way on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, a date for an extraordinary general election is proposed by the Presiding Officer and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).", "On December 28, 2015, ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game, marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl. Unlike NBC and Fox, CBS does not have a Spanish-language outlet of its own that could broadcast the game (though per league policy, a separate Spanish play-by-play call was carried on CBS's second audio program channel for over-the-air viewers). ESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe, called the game. Pre-game and post-game coverage was broadcast by ESPN Deportes, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike.", "In 1507, he was ordained to the priesthood, and in 1508, von Staupitz, first dean of the newly founded University of Wittenberg, sent for Luther, to teach theology.

NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C.

Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther, while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man \"in this life\" (homo enim in hac vita) tired from his daily labour (defatigus diurno labore) who at night enters his bedchamber (sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams.", "According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\" According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, more wealth than the bottom 90 percent is now owned by the \"richest 1 percent in the United States\". Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a \"substantial head start\". In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, \"over 60 percent\" of the Forbes richest 400 Americans \"grew up in substantial privilege\".", "Its opposition to Imperialism was expressed by the early United States, at least in a form distinct from its own Manifest Destiny, through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine. However, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, all this was changed by policies such as Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s mission to \"make the world safe for democracy\". Military force often backed them, but they were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba was created by Americans who opposed imperialism. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. Smedley Butler, an American general, denounced American foreign policy as a \"racket\". He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts.

The devolved competencies are extended by the Scotland Act 2012. For the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty, the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of Scotland. However, under the terms of the Scotland Act, Westminster agreed to devolve some of its responsibilities over Scottish domestic policy to the Scottish Parliament. Education, health, agriculture and justice are included by such \"devolved matters\". The Scottish Parliament was enabled by the Scotland Act to pass primary legislation on these issues. A degree of domestic authority, and all foreign policy, remain with the UK Parliament in Westminster. The Scottish Parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability. Another of the roles of the Parliament is to hold the Scottish Government to account.", "In the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. Flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006) was involved by this. Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade.", "Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. The body is generally patrolled by phagocytes searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Nutrients were acquired by phagocytosis as a means of acquiring them, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. The oldest form of host defense is probably represented by phagocytosis, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.", "Despite the high position given to Muslims, some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely discriminated against them, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision, as well as Kosher butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding massacred the Muslims.", "This is true throughout most of the United States as well. However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a \"platoon\" system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. A strong sense of security is still derived by students by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.", "The Panthers offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.

Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire. As it developed, roles of trade with France were taken on by the new empire, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism.

The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.", "Along with giving the offender his \"just deserts\", achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment. Brownlee argues, \"Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law\u2019s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.\" Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes, \"In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good.

Many examples of architecture from the gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical periods are provided by Warsaw, and around a quarter of the city is filled with luxurious parks and royal gardens.", "The customary law of Normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in Latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues: These are the Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier (Very ancient customary), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the Grand coutumier de Normandie (Great customary of Normandy, originally Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali), authored between 1235 and 1245.", "Special episodes of its late night talk shows were broadcast by CBS as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game. Following a break for late local programming, a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden was aired by CBS.", "In 1898, a radio-controlled boat\u2014which he dubbed \"teleautomaton\"\u2014was demonstrated to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden by Tesla. Outrageous claims about the workings of the boat, such as magic, telepathy, and being piloted by a trained monkey hidden inside, were made by the crowd that witnessed the demonstration. Little interest was shown by them. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, a number of countries used it in military programs when. The opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" was taken by Tesla in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.", "The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general-purpose aggressiveness. Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.", "The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only \"always oppose\" infidels \"in every way,\" but \"hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake,\" that democracy \"is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century,\" that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc. While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the \"gold standard\" of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.", "What intractability means in practice is open to debate. It does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are, saying that a problem is not in P. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem are routinely handled by SAT solvers over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem.", "The main provisions on equal treatment of workers are set out by the Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, equal treatment in respect of tax is required by article 7(2). In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement was rejected by the Court of Justice. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\" must be received by people, although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".", "are prime for any natural number n. Here  represents the floor function, i.e., largest integer not greater than the number in question. The latter formula can be shown using Bertrand's postulate (proven first by Chebyshev), which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n \u2212 2, for any natural number n > 3. However, it requires the knowledge of infinitely many primes to begin with, computing A or \u03bc. Another formula is based on Wilson's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once.", "With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves.", "In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538\u2013710) and the early Nara period (710\u2013794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih\u014d Code (701) and re-stated in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.", "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\"), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 nematocytes are incorporated into their bodies for defense by some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs. Striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed, are contained by them, however this is not a correct transformation as the agent 'they' is referring to 'The tentilla of Euplokamis' and the patient is a part of a complex sentence. A more accurate transformation would be: \nThe tentilla of Euplokamis contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed, however this sentence is already in active voice and the agent 'The tentilla of Euplokamis' is the subject, to transform it into passive voice we need to rephrase the sentence. \nA possible transformation could be: \nStriated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora, is contained by the tentilla of Euplokamis, which are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. Smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type, produce the wriggling motion. Smooth muscle may tighten the coils.", "Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption, rather than income should be the measure of inequality, and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that \"the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality,\" and consumption is more important than income. According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. Journalist Thomas B. Edsall summarizes the debate in \"The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor\". Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality, and the CBO's study found consumption data not \"adequately\" capturing \"consumption by high-income households\" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.", "Trade links with other nearby city-states, as well as commercial centres in Persia, Arabia, and even India, were established by the Swahili, and Mombasa was built into a major port city by the Swahili. By the 15th-century, Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa claimed that \"Mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar.\"", "Luther objected to a saying attributed to Johann Tetzel that \"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs.\"", "Tem\u00fcjin was probably born in 1162 in Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog, near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen rivers in modern-day northern Mongolia, not far from the current capital Ulaanbaatar. The Secret History of the Mongols reports that Tem\u00fcjin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist, a traditional sign that he was destined to become a great leader. He was the second-oldest son of his father Yes\u00fcgei, a Khamag Mongol's major chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe, and the oldest son of his mother Hoelun.

It is the first Super Bowl held in the San Francisco Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX in 1985, and the first in California since Super Bowl XXXVII took place in San Diego in 2003.", "When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.", "Mathematicians made advances in polynomial algebra during the Yuan era. Simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns were solved by the mathematician Zhu Shijie (1249\u20131314) using a rectangular array of coefficients, equivalent to modern matrices. A method of elimination was used by Zhu to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown. His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns, written in 1303. A diagram of Pascal's triangle is contained by the opening pages. The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book.", "Their local rivals, Polonia Warsaw, have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win Ekstraklasa Championship in 2000.

All uses of sculpture are represented, from tomb and memorial, to portrait, allegorical, religious, mythical, statues for gardens including fountains, as well as architectural decorations. Marble, alabaster, stone, terracotta, wood (history of wood carving), ivory, gesso, plaster, bronze, lead and ceramics are included by materials used.", "For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms cause friction, but it manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag are included by nonconservative forces other than friction. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.", "Aspects of the distribution of primes are concerned by a third type of conjectures. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). That for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n, states that Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. The stronger Cram\u00e9r's conjecture implies it.", "In addition to the General Assembly Hall, buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council were also used by the Parliament. The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The Parliament's visitors' centre and shop were housed by the former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council), whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal committee room.", "This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes.

Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. The word \"weak\" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins. Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big Bang.", "The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight with a live S-IV was launched from LC-37. Five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965 followed this. Pegasus satellites, which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts, were carried by the last three of these, which further supported the Apollo program.", "Its meaning is kept by the notion \"force\" in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation instead of Newtonian equations. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes \"quantized\", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of \"forces\". However, the potentials V(x,y,z) or fields, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated similar to classical position variables, i.e., .", "Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ten times their own weight can be eaten by ctenophores in a day. Only 100\u2013150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. Different species are enabled by these variations to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.", "Teachers in Wales can be registered members of trade unions such as ATL, NUT or NASUWT and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of teachers in Wales is falling with teachers being younger than in previous years.

The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction. By this means, efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower is given by the simple-expansion uniflow engine.

It involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: \"The place of learning is where the real bulk of it takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop.

Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life. That is, the Trinity was depicted not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known by Luther. A divine unity with separate personalities is sanctified by the Spirit.

The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the \u00c5land islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, are specifically excluded by the TEU from the jurisdiction of European Union law.

His \"Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ\" (\"Praise be to You, Jesus Christ\") became the main hymn for Christmas. \"Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist\" was written by him for Pentecost, and he adopted for Easter \"Christ ist erstanden\" (Christ is risen), based on Victimae paschali laudes. \"Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin\", a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis, was intended for Purification, but became also a funeral hymn. The Te Deum was paraphrased as \"Herr Gott, dich loben wir\" with a simplified form of the melody by him. It became known as the German Te Deum.", "The Ten Commandments, and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism, are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life. Luther's teaching of the Ten Commandments, therefore, has clear eschatological overtones, which, characteristically for Luther, do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common, daily vocations of this perishing world.", "However, Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective disputes this definition. The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau\u2019s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, \u201cResign.\u201d If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then he was insisted on being confronted with the fact that he was making a choice by Thoreau. But if government is \u201cthe voice of the people,\u201d as it is often called, shouldn\u2019t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is \u201cliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\u201d Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said would not be compelled by this fact. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?", "On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, his South Fifth Avenue laboratory, and later another at 46 E. Houston Street, in New York, were established by Tesla. Electric lamps were lit wirelessly at both locations, demonstrating the potential of wireless power transmission by him. In the same year, the Tesla coil was patented by him.", "The direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass is asserted by Newton's Second Law. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. How or whether this connection is relevant on microscales is unclear. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.", "90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S. was represented by the three major networks (by 1980, the three major networks represented 90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S.). Several flagship series debuted on the network during this time including Dynasty, an opulent drama from Aaron Spelling that became a hit when it premiered as a midseason series in 1981, five months before Spelling's other ABC hit Charlie's Angels ended its run. The continued successes of Happy Days, Three's Company, Laverne & Shirley, and Fantasy Island also propelled the network during the early 1980s, and it gained new hits in Too Close for Comfort, Soap spinoff Benson, and Happy Days spinoff Mork & Mindy. In 1981, the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS), a cable channel operated as a joint venture with the Hearst Corporation offering cultural and arts programming, which aired as a nighttime service over the channel space of Nickelodeon, was launched by ABC (through its ABC Video Services division).", "The hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices were noted by Tesla. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, the skin damage was attributed to various causes by him. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.", "In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a \"system of transmitting electrical energy\" and \"an electrical transmitter.\" When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).", "Exiles were welcomed home by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat \u2013 whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (infitah); transferring Egypt's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and making peace with Israel \u2013 in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists. His \"encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement\" was said to have been \"imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed.\"  This \"gentlemen's agreement\" between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions. Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s.

Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe's largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The region is provided with drinking water by the Ruhr. It contributes 70 m3/s (2,500 cu ft/s) to the Rhine. A considerable degree of pollution is still carried by other rivers in the Ruhr Area, above all, the Emscher.", "Command of British forces in North America was assumed by William Shirley. At a meeting in Albany in December 1755, his plans for 1756 were laid out by him. In addition to renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point and Duquesne, attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec were proposed by him.

As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.", "Despite his victory in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield. The German Peasants' War of 1524\u201325, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name, was helped instigate by preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas M\u00fcntzer. There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Many peasants were led to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general by Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with \"liberal\" phraseology. Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as M\u00fcntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.", "Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Similar reservations have been expressed by most other member states. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.", "On Carolina's next possession a fumble, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line, was lost by fullback Mike Tolbert while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart.

A second season was earned by only late-season premiere Happy Endings. Meanwhile, the new lows hit by Brothers & Sisters led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only drama renewal, V, also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run.

Only 1% to 3% of the turbine power is consumed by the work required by the pump and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle.

Baptized Members are those who have been baptized as an infant or child, but who have not subsequently professed their own faith. These Baptized Members become Professing Members through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith. Individuals who were not previously baptized are baptized as part of their profession of faith and thus become Professing Members in this manner. Individuals may also become a Professing Member through transfer from another Christian denomination.", "The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei, who was influenced by the late Medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus. An experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century was constructed by Galileo. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force, for example friction.", "On April 20, Kennedy sent Vice President Lyndon B.

The season was started 14\u20130 by Carolina, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13\u20130 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15\u20131 regular season record, home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs was clinched by the Panthers for the first time in franchise history.

Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, the difference between imperialism and colonialism is distinguished by Edward Said by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as imperialism lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]", "T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules are expressed by Helper T cells. The helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation, recognizes the MHC:antigen complex. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200\u2013300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell is also required by Helper T cell activation. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. The microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells are enhanced by cytokine signals produced by helper T cells. In addition, an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells, is caused by helper T cell activation.", "The First British Empire was based on mercantilism, and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India. The loss of the American colonies in 1776 reversed its growth. An informal economic empire was made by Britain in India, Australia, and through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies about 1820. By the 1840s, a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world had been adopted by Britain. After losing its first Empire to the Americans, its attention was then turned by Britain towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, its imperial holdings around the globe were expanded by Britain.

However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a \"platoon\" system, involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. A strong sense of security is still derived by students by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.", "A \"Small Business Big Game\" contest, in which Death Wish Coffee had a 30-second commercial aired free of charge courtesy of QuickBooks, was sponsored by QuickBooks.

His worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 was had by Manning. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, the NFL was led in interceptions by Manning. In week 10, a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot was suffered by Manning. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but four interceptions were thrown by him in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, number one was ranked by the team in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, home-field advantage was earned by the Broncos throughout the AFC playoffs, and the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record.", "Southern California consists of one of the more varied collections of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diversity outnumbering other major regions in the state and country.

In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law. Further, Newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body. It gives a formula that relates the mass () and the radius () of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration combining these ideas.", "The steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures, was independently discovered by Watt. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature. The understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine was given engineers by the thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle.", "In 1882, Tesla began working for the Continental Edison Company in France, designing and making improvements to electrical equipment.

The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies,[Note 3] and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body. Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body, a force \u2212F is exerted by the second body on the first body. F and \u2212F are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

This relationship was demonstrated by Kuznets using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] was not necessarily disproved by this.

Worldvision was sold to a consortium of ABC executives for nearly $10 million.", "The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency. It is also not possible to abolish these rights. This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future. Still, they are less common than in many other countries. Overall, between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% (including rise from 0.5% to 6.1% in the former GDR). 11.1% was reached by percent of students in private high schools.", "Following guidelines set in the National Cycling strategy, its cycling strategy was first developed by Newcastle in 1998. As of 2012, the local council social aims and objectives for cycling include: highlighting the usage of cycling to cut city congestion; educating that cycling promotes healthy living\u2026 The authority also has infrastructure aims and objectives which include: developing on road cycle networks on quieter streets; making safer routes on busier streets; innovating and implementing contraflows on one way streets; developing the existing off road cycle route networks and improve signage; joining up routes that are partially or completely isolated; Increase the number of cycle parking facilities; working with employers to integrate cycling into workplace travel plans; link the local networks to national networks.", "The area controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire was crossed by the Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons. After compiling intelligence from many sources his army, which was divided into three groups, was carefully prepared by Genghis Khan. The first division was led into the northeast of Khwarezmia by his son Jochi. The second division under Jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarzemia to form, with the first division, a pincer attack on Samarkand. Khwarzemia was attacked by the third division under Genghis Khan and Tolui from that direction.", "Giuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p \u2212 1 or a divisor of p \u2212 1. p divides the factorial ( p \u2212 1 ) ! + 1.

His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Forts were constructed and garrisoned by Marin. Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) was first constructed by him on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. A second fort at Fort Le Boeuf (present-day Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek, was constructed by Marin. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson, a chief of the Mingo, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. The French (whom he accused of killing and eating his father) were intensely disliked by him. Traveling to Fort Le Boeuf, the French were threatened with military action by him, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.", "Economic and political integration has been accelerated by the judicial branch of the EU, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and playing an important role in the development of EU law. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). The judges elect a president for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but questions can be referred to the EU court for a preliminary ruling by them. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.", "Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use. Steam was exhausted by compound engines in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.", "The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU). Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s. Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single, internal market in the Single European Act 1986, to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997, and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007. Since its establishment, more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties, from the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway in 1972 (though Norway did not end up joining), Greece in 1979, Spain and Portugal 1985, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1994 (though again Norway failed to join, because of lack of support in the referendum), the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004, Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2013. A Treaty giving it a special status was signed by Greenland in 1985.", "Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development. According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth. As a country develops, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality. Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.", "Commercial, scientific, and cultural growth was promoted by Kublai Khan. The circulation of paper banknotes (\u9214, Chao) was supported by him by protecting the Mongol postal system, constructing infrastructure, providing loans that financed trade caravans, and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes (\u9214, Chao). The spread of technologies, commodities, and culture between China and the West was enabled by Pax Mongolica, Mongol peace. The Grand Canal was expanded from southern China to Daidu in the north by Kublai. Mongol rule was cosmopolitan under Kublai Khan. Foreign visitors to his court, such as the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China, were welcomed by him. Many others like Christopher Columbus would later be inspired by Marco Polo's travels to chart a passage to the Far East in search of its legendary wealth.", "The plague disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338\u201339 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, a decline in farming and trading was caused by the 13th century Mongol conquest. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. An estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians were killed by epidemics that may have included plague during the 15 years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.", "Tesla was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 142 pounds (64 kg), with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926.:292 He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities.", "During the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Taiwan was absorbed by Japan.

During World War I, German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province, as well as the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands, were taken by Japan. In 1918, parts of far eastern Russia and parts of eastern Siberia were occupied by Japan as a participant in the Siberian Intervention. In 1931 Manchuria was conquered from China by Japan. During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China and by the end of the Pacific War, much of the Far East, including Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia, part of New Guinea and some islands of the Pacific Ocean was conquered by Japan. Thailand was also invaded by Japan, pressuring the country into a Thai/Japanese alliance.

Certain concessions were made by Luther to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector, and promised to remain silent if his opponents did. The theologian Johann Eck, however, was determined to expose Luther's doctrine in a public forum. In June and July 1519, Luther was invited to speak by he at Leipzig and a disputation with Luther's colleague Andreas Karlstadt was staged by he. Luther's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture, and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible. For this, Luther was branded a new Jan Hus by Eck, referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415. From that moment, he himself was devoted by him to Luther's defeat.", "In past times, corporal punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world.

To function properly, they must be detected by an immune system, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguished from the organism's own healthy tissue, where \"they\" refers to a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity.

By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking. The French language was preserved by the Berlin Huguenots in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07. Many of their descendents rose to positions of prominence.

In response, their attention may be concentrated by teachers on motivated students, ignoring attention-seeking and disruptive students. The result of this is that motivated students, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources. Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, this policy may be regarded as appropriate by administrators and governors.", "The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth). Its main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called \"balancers\", that sense its orientation. A transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia protects the statocyst. A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers. The animal's \"mood\", in other words the overall state of the nervous system, determines its response. For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it will often put some comb rows into reverse, spinning the mouth towards the prey.", "In December 1878, all relations with his family were severed by Tesla to hide the fact that he dropped out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River. Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month. His spare time was spent playing cards with local men on the streets by him. In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused.

Fuller has described as the fundamentalist \"guardians of the tradition\" (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the \"vanguard of change and Islamic reform\" centered around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that \"Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century\" when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on \"sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,\" and rejection of Shia Islam. Islamism can now not survive without the other by neither. While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, democratic elections are needed by Islamists to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.", "The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world.

A \"non-self\" target, such as a pathogen, is recognized by T cells only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a \"self\" receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the killer T cell and the helper T cell. In addition there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response. Antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules are only recognized by killer T cells, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. The different roles of the two types of T cell are reflected by these two mechanisms of antigen presentation. A third, minor subtype are the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.", "To remedy the causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door. The manned Block I program was discontinued by NASA, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Modified, fire-resistant Block II space suits would also exclusively be worn by crew members, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.", "Somewhere around a billion years ago, an early eukaryotic cell was entered by a free-living cyanobacterium, either as food or as an internal parasite, but it managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in. The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost. The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).", "Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, normal tissues result from being attacked by a hyperactive immune system as if they were foreign organisms. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus are included by common autoimmune diseases. The study of all aspects of the immune system is covered by immunology.", "Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: prestige and the social status of the 'old school tie'; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities (e.g. playing fields, swimming pools, etc.), higher-paid teachers; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education. The removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools, is offered by some schools. Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer. Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.[citation needed]", "Plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the stroma, but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network. In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly, attached directly to their parent thylakoid. In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a thylakoid.", "Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, an intuitive understanding for describing forces can be provided by this. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.", "Tesla was put firmly on the \"AC\" side of the so-called \"War of Currents,\" an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888, by Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888. This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and his own patented AC system was used by Westinghouse to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system to Westinghouse, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. AC development was pursued by Thomas Edison in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.", "The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines. Internal combustion engines or electric motors have largely superseded steam for mobile applications. However, most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. A renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover has been incited by recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution. This is becoming known as the Advanced Steam movement.[citation needed]", "Natural killer cells, or NK cells, are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes. Rather, compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, are destroyed by NK cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as \"missing self.\" Cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex) \u2013 a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells, are described by this term. They were named \"natural killer\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are \"missing self.\" For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of \"missing self\". NK cells do not recognize and attack normal body cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) which essentially put the brakes on NK cells recognize those MHC antigens.", "Starting in 1965, the same message routing methodology as developed by Baran was independently developed by Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. It was called packet switching, a more accessible name than Baran's, and proposed to build a nationwide network in the UK by him.

A battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity was seen by the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells \u2013 more precisely, phagocytes \u2013 that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism\u2019s \u201chumors\u201d rather than its cells.", "The movement which would become The United Methodist Church began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England. A small group of students, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, met on the Oxford University campus. A holy life was focused on by them, methodical study of scripture and Bible study. They were mocked by other students, saying they were the \"Holy Club\" and \"the Methodists\", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. Eventually, individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life were started by the so-called Methodists.", "The concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity. The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. The principle of inertia was extended further by Albert Einstein when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame. This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity.", "The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.", "The Rhine was crossed by Germanic tribes in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine. This \"Germanic Heroic Age\" is reflected in medieval legend, such as the Nibelungenlied which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) (\"dragons rock\"), near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild's golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.", "Within southern California are two major cities, Los Angeles and San Diego, as well as three of the country's largest metropolitan areas.

To the south and with a population of 1,307,402 is San Diego, the second most populous city in the state and the eighth most populous in the nation.", "The year was finished by Manning with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. In contrast, Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns and six interceptions for a rating of 86.4. The team was led by Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. A big impact was also made by running back Ronnie Hillman with 720 yards, five touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.7 yards per carry average. Overall, any Pro Bowl selections were not had by the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points.", "Grissom, White, and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight. Tests of their spacecraft were trained and conducted by them at North American, and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. A \"plugs-out\" test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power. If successful, a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch, with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled, would follow this.", "In 1893, the bid to light the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current was won by George Westinghouse, beating out a General Electric bid by one million dollars. A building was devoted to electrical exhibits by this World's Fair. It was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse demonstrated the safety, reliability, and efficiency of a fully integrated alternating current system to the American public. At the Columbian Exposition, under a banner announcing the \"Tesla Polyphase System\", a wireless gas-discharge lamp was demonstrated by Tesla to light it, as part of a series of electrical effects previously performed throughout America and Europe,:76 using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current.:79 An observer noted:", "A passion for (and became very proficient at) billiards, chess and card-playing was developed by Tesla during his second year of study at Graz, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.:43, 301 On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.:208 Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept.

The western frontier of Kublai's domain was threatened by Ogedei's grandson Kaidu, who refused to submit to Kublai. The hostile but weakened Song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south. The hostage prince Wonjong was secured by Kublai in 1259 by installing him as the ruler of Korea, making it a Mongol tributary state. Domestic unrest also threatened Kublai. A revolt against Mongol rule in 1262 was instigated by Li Tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official. After successfully suppressing the revolt, the influence of the Han Chinese advisers in his court was curbed by Kublai. He feared that his dependence on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song.", "The Command Module was supported by a cylindrical Service Module (SM), with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants, and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants. A high-gain S-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights. On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. The Service Module was discarded just before re-entry. The module was 24.6 feet (7.5 m) long and 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter. Approximately 51,300 pounds (23,300 kg) was weighed by the initial lunar flight version fully fueled, while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds (24,000 kg).", "In June 1978, Arledge created the newsmagazine 20/20; after its first episode received harshly negative reviews, the program \u2013 which debuted as a summer series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 \u2013 was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, with Hugh Downs appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former Today colleague Barbara Walters). In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, and all of its 300 employees were laid off (Universal Music Group has since acquired the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels).", "After this, Huguenots (with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000) fled to surrounding Protestant countries: England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, and Prussia \u2014 whose Calvinist Great Elector Frederick William welcomed them to help rebuild his war-ravaged and underpopulated country. Following this exodus, Huguenots remained in large numbers in only one region of France: the rugged C\u00e9vennes region in the south. In the early 18th century, a regional group known as the Camisards who were Huguenots rioted against the Catholic Church in the region, burning churches and killing clergy. It took years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards to French troops, between 1702 and 1709.", "In accordance with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel was expressed by Luther, who sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy. Two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience, deeply influenced him. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. A love-hate relationship with Aristotle was developed by him over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.", "As a result, chloroplasts in C4 mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which are used by them to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. CO2 is stored in a four-carbon compound by them, which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off CO2 and returns to the mesophyll. The light reactions are not carried out by bundle sheath chloroplasts, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity. Because of this, thylakoids organized into grana stacks are lacked by them\u2014though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. Photosystem I \u2014 the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow is lacked by them, and they only have it. Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, large starch grains are often contained by them.", "Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. Coconuts, pineapples, cashew nuts, cotton, sugarcane, sisal, and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas. Unfortunately, the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security has not been attained by a significant portion of the population. Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and food is left to rot in the fields by farmers in other regions because they cannot access markets. This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross.", "In addition to chlorophylls, another group of yellow\u2013orange pigments called carotenoids are also found in the photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. The chlorophyll green is sometimes overridden by their bright colors. \u03b2-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.", "The fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1 + i) and (1 \u2212 i). Rational primes (i.e. prime elements in Z) of the form 4k + 3 are Gaussian primes, whereas rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not.", "In 1962, the ABC logo was redesigned into its best-known (and current) form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle, by graphic designer Paul Rand. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963\u201364 season. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics).", "The negotiations were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546. After 8 a.m., chest pains were experienced by him. When he went to his bed, he prayed, \"Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God\" (Ps. 31:5), the common prayer of the dying. At 1 a.m. he awoke with more chest pain and was warmed with hot towels. His Son was thanked by him for being revealed to him in whom he had believed. His companions, Justus Jonas and Michael Coelius, shouted loudly, \"Reverend father, are you ready to die trusting in your Lord Jesus Christ and to confess the doctrine which you have taught in his name?\" A distinct \"Yes\" was Luther's reply.", "The new British command was not in place until July. When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them. Bold action against his inertia was taken by Montcalm. His headquarters was moved to Ticonderoga by Montcalm, as if to presage another attack along Lake George, building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, the successful attack on Oswego in August was led by Montcalm. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The prisoners were not considered prizes and were prevented by the Europeans from being stripped of their valuables, which angered the Indians.", "The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants, was generated by Rankine steam cycles. It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath.", "A military campaign against the Chinese Song dynasty in southern China was commenced by M\u00f6ngke Khan. The Mongol force that invaded southern China was far greater than the force they sent to invade the Middle East in 1256. He died in 1259 without a successor. The Song was returned from by Kublai in 1260 when he learned that his brother, Ariq B\u00f6ke, was challenging his claim to the throne. A kurultai in Kaiping that elected him Great Khan was convened by Kublai. A rival kurultai in Mongolia proclaimed Ariq B\u00f6ke Great Khan, beginning a civil war. Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources. The Chinese era name of Zhongtong was bolstered by him among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese dynasties and adopting it. Inadequate supplies hampered Ariq B\u00f6ke and he surrendered in 1264. All of the three western khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate) became functionally autonomous, although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai as Great Khan. The Mongol Empire had been permanently divided by civil strife.", "This projection was not included in the final summary for policymakers. The IPCC has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final summary was robust. Regret for \"the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance\" was expressed by them.

None succeeded and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations in 1755, 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia; soon afterward the expulsion of the Acadians was ordered by them. William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, gave orders for the deportation without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty, were expelled. Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England.", "During the English Civil War, the North declared for the King. In a bid to gain Newcastle and the Tyne, the town of Newburn was captured by Cromwell's allies, the Scots. In 1644 the reinforced fortification on the Lawe in South Shields was captured by the Scots following a siege. In 1644 Cromwell's allies then besieged the city for many months and eventually stormed it ('with roaring drummes') and sacked it. The motto \"Fortiter Defendit Triumphans\" (\"Triumphing by a brave defence\") was bestowed upon the town by the grateful King. The Scots imprisoned Charles I in Newcastle in 1646\u20137.", "With the death of Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers. The five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools), now the Henry Cole Wing, was designed to the north west of the garden by him in 1867\u201372. Scott's assistant J.W.

However, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.", "Photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high. That Rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis\u2014it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, or CCMs. Crassulacean acid metabolism, C4 carbon fixation, and pyrenoids are included by these. Chloroplasts in C4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.", "With a budget of $230,000, Nafzger compiled the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 and assigned it to Lowry Digital for restoration.

Sound quality improvements were not included by the restored video, remaining in black and white.", "The lack of reliable statistics from this period hampers researchers. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.", "In addition to the General Assembly Hall, buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council were also used by the Parliament. The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The Parliament's visitors' centre and shop were housed by the former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council), whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's principal committee room.", "Artificial lightning was produced by him, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long.

The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI. Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter \"L\" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. Large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo, are also deviated from the template by the logo.", "On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria. Days later, still in 1851 gold was discovered near Ballarat, and subsequently at Bendigo. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. One of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen was triggered by this. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In ten years the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced including the \"richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world\" and the largest gold nugget. 20 million ounces of gold, one third of the world's output[citation needed], was produced by Victoria in the decade 1851\u20131860.", "Education in Wales differs in certain respects from education elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, the money it paid for the tariff could be recovered by Van Gend en Loos. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States\u2019. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. Their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union could be jeopardized by implementation. On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.", "62% of GDP is contributed by East and Central Africa's biggest economy. 22% of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the labour force (a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food security \u2013 an important catalyst of economic growth) A small portion of the population relies on food aid.[citation needed] Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP. 75% of GDP is contributed by the service, industry and manufacturing sectors, but 25% of the labour force is employed by them.", "The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades.

The companion was described as the main character of the show by Steven Moffat, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs. Pearl Mackie as Bill, the Doctor's newest traveling companion will be introduced by the tenth series.", "The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. It may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault finding the key bed in these situations.", "Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. A large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a small number (one or two) of genes is possessed by these animals. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.", "Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time \u2013 defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"gravitational force\".", "Comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews are conducted by pharmacists in Australia and they receive remuneration from the Australian Government for this. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and prescribing rights are being obtained because of pharmacy education by this. The government is also paying them for medicine use reviews. In Scotland prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications can be written by the pharmacist for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and one or two years of residency or fellowship training are now completed by some pharmacists following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy.\"", "Luther is honoured on 18 February with a commemoration in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints. In the Church of England's Calendar of Saints he is commemorated on 31 October.", "The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler. Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives.", "The programme's first serial, An Unearthly Child, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman. In the 1967 serial, Tomb of the Cybermen, when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"The Empty Child\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"Smith and Jones\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"Fear Her\" (2006) and \"The Doctor's Daughter\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.", "Luther refused to recant his writings. He is sometimes also quoted as saying: \"Here I stand. No other can be done by me. Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable, since they were inserted before \"May God help me\" only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings. However, Mullett suggests that given his nature, \"we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words.\"", "Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO\n2).

The three sources of European Union law are primary law, secondary law and supplementary law. The main sources of primary law are the Treaties establishing the European Union. Regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties are included by secondary sources. The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which under the Treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties.", "Various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists, were reflected by the system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan. While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Strong influence was given by Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. The traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: \u6a1e\u5bc6\u9662) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection was adopted by this government. A major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions was shown by the actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of K\u00fcl\u00fcg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.", "Subordinate to the General Conference are the jurisdictional and central conferences which also meet every four years.

Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment and optimization.", "In many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market. Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. The income gap in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain.", "Their local rivals, Polonia Warsaw, have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win Ekstraklasa Championship in 2000. They also won the country\u2019s championship in 1946, and the cup was won twice by them as well. Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the Old Town. Polonia was relegated from the country's top flight in 2013 because of their disastrous financial situation. They are now playing in the 4th league (5th tier in Poland) -the bottom professional league in the National \u2013 Polish Football Association (PZPN) structure.", "Early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices were made by Tesla. He tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project.

Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.", "Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997, the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy, which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the Social Chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam. The main legislation previously agreed under the Agreement on Social Policy, the 1994 Works Council Directive, which required workforce consultation in businesses, and the 1996 Parental Leave Directive was subsequently adopted by the UK. In the 10 years following the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam and adoption of the Social Chapter, policy initiatives in various social policy areas, including labour and industry relations, equal opportunity, health and safety, public health, protection of children, the disabled and elderly, poverty, migrant workers, education, training and youth have been undertaken by the European Union.", "Private schools generally prefer to be called independent schools, because of their freedom to operate outside of government and local government control. Some of these are also known as public schools. Pupils aged up to 13 years old are prepared by preparatory schools in the UK to enter public schools. The name \"public school\" is based on the fact that the schools were open to pupils from anywhere, and not merely to those from a certain locality, and of any religion or occupation. According to The Good Schools Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying schools at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.[citation needed] Many independent schools are single-sex (though this is becoming less common).

This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: \"It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace.\" The existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death, was rejected by him. The continuity of one's personal identity beyond death was affirmed by him. In his Smalcald Articles, the saints were described as currently residing \"in their graves and in heaven\" by him.", "In the immediate post-war years there was little money available for other than essential repairs. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. Flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006) was involved by this. Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade.", "Terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest, is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. Agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment were allowed by the development of this fertile soil; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida found remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest in 2003. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.", "Egyptians brought about one of its earliest massive implementations against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution.

Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin.

Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy were primarily trained by the early College. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. The university was led by James Bryant Conant through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.", "The place was taken by the world's first railway journey. A number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency were incorporated by the design.

After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first successful credit card; that is, a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as Visa Inc.", "Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.", "Richard Trevithick built the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the world's first railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales.

Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the chief electrician position was allocated by the Budapest Telephone Exchange and the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional. During his employment, many improvements to the Central Station equipment were made by Tesla and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.", "According to the UK Government's returned 2001 census information, the city of Newcastle had a population of 189,863, whereas the metropolitan borough of Newcastle had a population of around 259,000.

On the next play, it was knocked out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered by Ealy for Carolina on the 50-yard line. Gano's 39-yard field goal was set up by a 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16\u201310. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.", "In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. \u1f04\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \"lifeless\"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the name in French and several other European languages.", "Because of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerst\u00e4tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. Between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species, were had by all three. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. A comb jelly could putatively be represented by the Ediacaran Eoandromeda.", "Where CHP is not used, surface condensers are used as a cold sink by steam turbines in power stations. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. About twenty times as much would be needed by a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant.", "A rich cultural diversity developed during the Yuan dynasty. The major cultural achievements were the development of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular. Trade between East and West was promoted by the political unity of China and much of central Asia. A fair amount of cultural exchange was produced by the Mongols' extensive West Asian and European contacts. China was also very much influenced by the other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire. This development was encouraged by the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate. Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period. Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet were introduced in East Asia by the Muslims of the Yuan dynasty. Eastern crops such as carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons, high-quality granulated sugar, and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the Yuan dynasty.", "Early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices were made by Tesla.

The abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing, is prohibited by Article 102. Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC). The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies.

A series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter is used by these engines. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. The low-pressure expansion stages were divided between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine, by Y-S-T engines. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. The virtually vibration-free turbine engine ultimately replaced this.", "Later in life, the Van de Graaff generator was studied by Tesla after whom claims concerning a \"teleforce\" weapon were made.

When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them. Bold action against his inertia was taken by Montcalm. His headquarters was moved to Ticonderoga by Montcalm, as if to presage another attack along Lake George, building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, the successful attack on Oswego in August was led by Montcalm. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The prisoners were not considered prizes and were prevented by the Europeans from being stripped of their valuables, which angered the Indians.", "Funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/voucher funds, and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals. Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments. Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status.", "When the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At a pre-arranged announced time, one at a time they stepped across the \"line\" and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A well known civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead \"nolo contendere\", as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty. The test site grounds were not reentered by their.", "Howard Zinn writes, \"There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\"", "A greater practical effect on imports than domestic products is often had by rules that apply to all goods neutrally, but may have this effect. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought, were rejected by the Court of Justice. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. Consumers would be protected just as effectively by labelling. In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". Other vegetable fats were used by British, Danish and Irish manufacturers. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, article 34 can also be infringed by this. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, importers were disproportionately affected by the law, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: that \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\" would have it. It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.", "Sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike. They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else. Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. Sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, authority is absolute, punishment is capricious, and due process of law is unknown.", "Mass murders were caused by the invasions of Baghdad, Samarkand, Urgench, Kiev, Vladimir among others, such as when portions of southern Khuzestan were completely destroyed.

P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, his financial difficulties were explained by Westinghouse to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided to Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.", "The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities.

The town of Otrar was quickly seized by the Mongol army, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Molten silver was poured into his ears and eyes by Genghis Khan.

As it spread to western Europe, the region was entered by the disease also. By autumn 1347, Alexandria in Egypt was reached by the plague, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348\u201349, Antioch was reached by the disease. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.[citation needed]", "Several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network, including Kung Fu, The Six Million Dollar Man, Wonder Woman, Starsky & Hutch, Charlie's Angels, The Bionic Woman, Fantasy Island and Battlestar Galactica, highlighted the 1970s. Silverman, who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division, greenlit many of these series. The rousing success of Happy Days also led to a successful spin-off series, Laverne & Shirley, which debuted in 1976. Charlie's Angels and Three's Company (which debuted in 1977) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as \"jiggle TV\", featuring attractive, often buxom, women in main and guest roles.", "The national anthem was performed by six-time Grammy winner and Academy Award nominee Lady Gaga, while Academy Award winner Marlee Matlin provided American Sign Language (ASL) translation.", "Many university rankings have highly ranked Harvard. In particular, it has consistently topped the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) since 2003, and the THE World Reputation Rankings since 2011, when the first time such league tables were published. When the QS and Times were published in partnership as the THE-QS World University Rankings during 2004-2009, Harvard had also been regarded the first in every year. The University's undergraduate program has been continuously among the top two in the U.S. News & World Report. In 2014, the University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP) was topped by Harvard.

Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. The fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker, is exploited by this approach. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.", "Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24\u201310 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.", "The Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for conquest of Hungary and Europe. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. Transoxiana and Persia were added to an already formidable empire by these invasions while any resistance along the way was destroyed by these invasions. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson Batu and the Golden Horde, the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.", "Packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm, circuit switching, a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session, each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes. In cases of billable services, such as cellular communication services, a fee per unit of connection time characterizes circuit switching, even when no data is transferred, while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted, such as characters, packets, or messages.", "\"The Islamic State\", formerly known as the \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\" and before that as the \"Islamic State of Iraq\", (and called the acronym Daesh by its many detractors), is a Wahhabi/Salafi jihadist extremist militant group which is led by and mainly composed of Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria. In 2014, the group proclaimed itself a caliphate, with religious, political and military authority over all Muslims worldwide.

In an analysis of the effects of intensive Anglo-American liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism, where unions have remained strong, they concluded \"The U.S. economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves labor-market outcomes is provided by the available evidence. Despite popular prejudices to the contrary, a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available is consistently afforded by the U.S. economy.", "He is viewed positively by some in the Inner Mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of Mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million, almost twice the population of Mongolia. While Genghis Khan never conquered all of China, the Yuan dynasty that is often credited with re-uniting China was established by his grandson Kublai Khan and completed that conquest. There has been much artwork and literature praising Genghis as a great military leader and political genius. An indelible imprint was left on Chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the Jin dynasty relatively fewer by the years of the Mongol-established Yuan dynasty. In general the legacy of Genghis Khan and his successors, who completed the conquest of China after 65 years of struggle, remains a mixed topic.[citation needed]", "The flow of cold, gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake. The cold water flows near the surface and at first doesn't mix with the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake. But then, at the so-called Rheinbrech, the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water. The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. The northern shore is then followed by the water until Hagnau am Bodensee. A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake \u00dcberlingen. Most of the water flows via the Constance hopper into the Rheinrinne (\"Rhine Gutter\") and Seerhein.

To finance the purchase, $2.1 billion was borrowed by Capital Cities from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cities could not acquire or retain due to FCC ownership rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One). Warren Buffett, who promised that his company Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece, loaned the remaining $500 million. Due to an FCC ban on same-market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E.

It involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, teaching itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly. For example, an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows: \"The place of learning is where the real bulk of it takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all.

Enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students. Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior. His personal goals must be guided by a teacher in aligning his academic goals. Stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions are shown by students who receive this positive influence.", "In 1564 a group of Norman Huguenots under the leadership of Jean Ribault established the small colony of Fort Caroline on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, Florida.

A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at St. Augustine failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas. Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez. Menendez proceeded to massacre the defenseless Huguenots, after which he wiped out the Fort Caroline garrison.", "In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. The program was disliked by them, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.", "The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass.

They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.", "Mass murders were caused by the invasions of Baghdad, Samarkand, Urgench, Kiev, Vladimir among others, such as when portions of southern Khuzestan were completely destroyed. Baghdad was sacked by Hulagu's descendant Ghazan Khan although his forces were halted by the Mamluks of Egypt, but Hulagu's descendant Ghazan Khan would return to beat the Egyptian Mamluks right out of Levant, Palestine and even Gaza. According to the works of the Persian historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, more than 70,000 people were killed by the Mongols in Merv and more than 190,000 in Nishapur. In 1237 an invasion was launched into Kievan Rus' by Batu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan. Over the course of three years, all of the major cities of Eastern Europe with the exceptions of Novgorod and Pskov were destroyed and annihilated by the Mongols.", "Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use. Steam was exhausted by compound engines in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.", "At present, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea, through the former Meuse estuary, near Rotterdam. The IJsselmeer, formerly the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon; however, since 1932, a freshwater lake, is entered by the river IJssel branch. The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches: the River Waal (6/9 of total discharge), the River Nederrijn \u2013 Lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the River IJssel (1/9 of total discharge). This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709, by river engineering works, including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century, with the help of weirs in the Nederrijn river.", "According to International Monetary Fund economists, inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells (not the rate of growth). Not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a country's institutions and high levels of education are prevented by high levels of inequality. According to IMF staff economists, \"if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.\"", "The base rate for a 30-second advertisement was set at $5,000,000, a record high price for a Super Bowl ad, by CBS. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game. Their Super Bowl debut was made by Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company, promoting the 20th anniversary of the Pok\u00e9mon video game and media franchise.", "The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties, especially among large firms. In the past, architects, interior designers, engineers, developers, construction managers, and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies, even in the larger firms. Presently, a firm that is nominally an \"architecture\" or \"construction management\" firm may have experts from all related fields as employees, or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill. Thus, itself may be offered as \"one-stop shopping\" for a construction project, from beginning to end, by each such firm. This is designated as a \"design build\" contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction, while adhering to the performance specifications.", "An average of $5 million was charged by CBS for a 30-second commercial during the game, and Super Bowl 50 was broadcast by CBS in the U.S. The British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively, headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. It was the third-most watched U.S. broadcast ever.", "At the beginning of the 20th century, the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods facilitated important advancement in geological science. The understanding of geologic time was changed by this. Previously, sections of rock relative to one another could only be dated by geologists using fossils and stratigraphic correlation. With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.", "Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell being completed by Peyton Manning. The ball was not moved by Carolina's defense, instead, A pair of carries by C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but the next three plays were dug in over by Carolina's defense. First, Ronnie Hillman was tackled by linebacker Shaq Thompson for a 3-yard loss. Then after an incompletion, Anderson was tackled by Thomas Davis for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3\u20130 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal. The first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit was marked by the score.", "Many works were read by Tesla, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory.:33 He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.:282 Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. A peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions, was suffered by him.:33 Often, the solution to a particular problem he had encountered was provided by them; at other times they would link the visions to a word or idea he might have come across. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail.:33 Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. Drawings were typically not made by him by hand but he worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.:33", "In 2002, the Costiff collection of 178 Vivienne Westwood costumes was acquired by the Museum.

The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory, and construct a fort for their protection. But, as the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims. In 1750 negotiations with the Indian tribes were opened by Christopher Gist, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, at Logstown, while he explored the Ohio territory. The 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians, through their \"Half-King\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative, agreed to terms that included permission to build a \"strong house\" at the mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was completed by him. By the late 17th century, it was kept as hunting ground by right of conquest by the Iroquois, and many tribes had been pushed out of the Ohio Valley by them.", "He was asked by Johann Eck if the books were his, and whether he stood by their contents.

The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies were made by article 66. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The enactment of competition law was established by the Treaty of Rome as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. Provisions on state aid were made by article 92. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.", "Runners were sent to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York by the Iroquois. The British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond, Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey, meaning \"He who does great things.\" Their languages were spoken by him and he had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area. In 1746, Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois. Later he was commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia. They met at Albany, New York with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies. Mohawk Chief Hendrick, Speaker of their tribal council, insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion. When Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, Chief Hendrick said that the \"Covenant Chain\", a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown, was broken.", "An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education. Growth as well as income inequality is increased and then decreased by increases in education, however, Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education. As a result, much lower wages are generally received by those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, growth is promoted by education because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.", "A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, Dyrrachium was besieged by the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, who landed in Valona using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho were occupied by them. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, their way was opened to Dibra by the Normans, and the Arbanon passes were secured by the Normans. Bohemond was forced to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis by the lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance.", "The Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Ruhr area.

Near Krefeld, the Uerdingen line, the line which separates the areas where Low German and High German are spoken, is crossed by the river.", "To make new legislation, the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts is defined by TFEU article 294. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. The Council must give authorisation for \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states. The Commission should inform member state governments at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.", "In October 1529, an assembly of German and Swiss theologians was convoked by Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, at the Marburg Colloquy, to establish doctrinal unity in the emerging Protestant states.

It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Terry Nation was commissioned by Whitaker to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". It had little choice but to use The Mutants, which was the only script ready to go, by the show. According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice \u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready, that would have been made by us. Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial \u2013 The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters were introduced by the serial, and the serial was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.", "A Mediterranean climate, with infrequent rain and many sunny days, is contained by Southern California.

The price of \"old oil\" (that which had already been discovered) was limited by the system while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater scarcity. Development of alternative energies was discouraged by the rule. The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Rationing addressed scarcity (as in many countries). Long lines at gas stations were faced by motorists beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.", "BSkyB's digital service was officially launched on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although small-scale tests were carried out before then. At this time an important distinction between the new service and Sky's analogue services was made by the use of the Sky Digital brand. Key selling points were the improvement in picture and sound quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open.... now called Sky Active, BSkyB competed with the ONdigital (later ITV Digital) terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which help bolstered BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.", "Following the Nice Treaty, there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent; a single constitutional document would have also been produced by this. However, as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands, the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force. Instead, the Lisbon Treaty was enacted. Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty, but it was formally an amending treaty, and \u2013 though it significantly altered the existing treaties \u2013 it did not completely replace them.", "Economic and political integration has been accelerated by the judicial branch of the EU, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and playing an important role in the development of EU law. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). The judges elect a president for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but questions can be referred to the EU court for a preliminary ruling by them. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate.

In favorable circumstances, ten times their own weight can be eaten by ctenophores in a day. Only 100\u2013150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named.

The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. Different species are enabled by these variations to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.", "Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.

Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm). They take mRNAs transcribed from the chloroplast DNA and them are translated into protein by them. While similar to bacterial ribosomes, chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria, so some chloroplast-unique features are included by chloroplast ribosomes. Motifs for shine-dalgarno sequence recognition, which is considered essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes, are lacked by small subunit ribosomal RNAs in several Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts. Such loss is also rarely observed in other plastids and prokaryotes.", "Always in search of new programs that would help it compete with NBC and CBS, ABC's management believed that sports could be a major catalyst in improving the network's market share.

Wide World of Sports, in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events.", "Particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation frequently evoked Luther's hymns. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the hymn \"Ein neues Lied wir heben an\" (\"A new song we raise\"), which is generally known in English by John C.

Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. Small populations are enabled to grow at an explosive rate by the combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction.", "The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a \"lifeboat\" in the event of a failure of the command ship. Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. A 1964 MSC study concluded, \"The LM [as lifeboat] ... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the SPS.\" Ironically, just such a failure happened on Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power. Propulsion, electrical power and life support were provided by the Lunar Module to get the crew home safely.", "In response to demands for a German liturgy, a German Mass, which he published in early 1526, was written by Luther. It was not intended by him as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the \"simple people\", a \"public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians.\" Everything that smacks of sacrifice was omitted by the Mass. The elevation of the host and chalice was retained by him, while trappings such as the Mass vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony. The conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass is noted by modern scholars. Congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the Creed, was included by Luther's service. Religious instruction was incorporated into the weekday services in the form of the catechism by Luther. Simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services were also provided by him.", "Protection for fundamental rights is not mentioned by none of the original treaties establishing the European Union. It was not envisaged for European Union measures, that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions, to be subject to human rights. At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights, hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights. Fundamental rights were recognised as general principle of European Union law by the European Court of Justice as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent. In 1999 a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions, was set up by the European Council. A list of fundamental rights is drawn by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties.", "In 1962, the ABC logo was redesigned into its best-known (and current) form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle, by graphic designer Paul Rand. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963\u201364 season. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics).", "Engineering News-Record (ENR) is a trade magazine for the construction industry.

In their reporting on the Top 400, data on transportation, sewer, hazardous waste and water was used by them to rank firms as heavy contractors.", "Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example, 512-bit primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024-bit primes are typical for Diffie\u2013Hellman.). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.", "The Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s Word and Image Department was under the same pressure being felt in archives around the world, to digitize their collection. A large scale digitization project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitize the collection. The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras. The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a \"Search the Collections\" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitization project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.", "Every May since 1987, the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of students compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list, has been held by the University of Chicago. Since 1963, campus is taken over by the Festival of the Arts (FOTA) for 7\u201310 days of exhibitions and interactive artistic endeavors. Every January, a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko, which include early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops, is held by the university. A summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians, and is home to Doc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the university, is also annually held by the university.

The college's academics are divided into five divisions: the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division, the Social Sciences Collegiate Division, the Humanities Collegiate Division, and the New Collegiate Division. The first four are sections within their corresponding graduate divisions, while the New Collegiate Division administers interdisciplinary majors and studies which do not fit in one of the other four divisions.", "The Norse religion and Old Norse language would be replaced by the descendants of Rollo's Vikings and their Frankish wives with Catholicism (Christianity) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people, blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique \"Norman\" culture in the north of France. The adoption of the indigenous langue d'o\u00efl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class forged the Norman language, and it developed into the regional language that survives today.", "Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O\n2. 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere is constituted by diatomic oxygen gas. However, a global downward trend is shown by monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.", "The Lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. Lobates are enabled to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey by this combination of structures.", "Jochi died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some scholars, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in Khorasan. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. His story is concluded by him with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. A service would be done by me if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims. Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.", "An average of $5 million was charged by CBS for a 30-second commercial during the game, and Super Bowl 50 was broadcast by CBS in the U.S. The British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively, headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show.

Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera \u2013 Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. Their descriptions of ctenophores are based by at least two textbooks on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.", "The company business strategy was started on by the service based on the idea from the then chief executive officer, Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch, of converting it to an entirely fee-based concept. New channels were introduced by the new package, which included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with at least one premium channel being taken by the majority as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994. The operations were criticized by Michael Grade in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage, mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels.", "There are two types of thylakoids\u2014granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300\u2013600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. Only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex is contained by the flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.", "Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as \"rent-seeking\". While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them. A larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort is brought by this process, known to economists as rent-seeking.", "The Yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China. In the historiography of Mongolia, it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire. Mongols are widely known to worship the Eternal Heaven, and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be \"the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious.\" In traditional historiography of China, on the other hand, the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the Song dynasty and the Ming dynasty. Note, however, Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (Chinese: \u592a\u7956). Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the Ming dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty), there also exist Chinese people[who?] who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as a period of foreign domination. The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens,[citation needed] and that China stagnated economically and scientifically.", "Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat. The religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes were retained by them until the rule of Louis XIV, who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France, and forced the Huguenots to convert. While nearly three-quarters of France eventually were killed  or submitted, France was fled by roughly 500,000 Huguenots by the early 18th century[citation needed].", "Today, Warsaw has some of the best medical facilities in Poland and East-Central Europe.

The infrastructure has developed a lot over the past years.", "At the heart of scholars' debate about Luther's influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis. Luther's influence is seen as limited by some scholars, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.\"", "Struggle, famine, and bitterness among the populace marked the final years of the Yuan dynasty. In time, all influence on other Mongol lands across Asia was lost by Kublai Khan's successors, while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese. Gradually, influence was lost by them in China as well. The reigns of the later Yuan emperors were short and marked by intrigues and rivalries. Dissension and unrest tore China. The country was ravaged by outlaws without interference from the weakening Yuan armies.", "A majority SNP government was produced by the election, making this the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority. 16 seats were taken by the SNP from Labour, with many of their key figures not returned to parliament, although Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes. A further eight seats were taken by the SNP from the Liberal Democrats and one seat from the Conservatives. The SNP overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.", "Originating as the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999, it pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2004, participated in the Iraqi insurgency that followed the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces, joined the fight in the Syrian Civil War beginning in March 2011, and was expelled from al-Qaeda in early 2014, (which complained of its failure to consult and \"notorious intransigence\"). Prominence was gained by the group after it drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in western Iraq in a 2014 offensive. The group is adept at social media, posting Internet videos of beheadings of soldiers, civilians, journalists and aid workers, and is known for its destruction of cultural heritage sites. Ethnic cleansing by the group on a \"historic scale\" has been reported by Amnesty International. The United Nations, the European Union and member states, the United States, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other countries have designated the group a terrorist organisation.", "Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.", "Design is linked to wider trends in British culture by the galleries. For instance, the spread of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain influenced design in the Tudor period. In the Stuart period, wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain was enabled by increasing trade, especially with Asia. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. Taste was also influenced by European styles seen on the Grand Tour. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade were produced by the growth of mass production. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&A. In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialization, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.", "The demand for large cars was reduced by the crisis. Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.", "Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace is that grace, offered by God to all people, that we receive by faith and trust in Christ, through which God pardons the believer of sin. It is in justifying grace we are received by God, in spite of our sin. In this reception, we are forgiven through the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the cross. We are cancelled of our guilt and empowered by the justifying grace to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor. Today, justifying grace is also known as conversion, \"accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior,\" or being \"born again\". This experience was originally called the New Birth by John Wesley. This experience can occur in different ways; it can be one transforming moment, such as an altar call experience, or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time.", "Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. By former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts, it was founded as a means of making ARPANET technology public. He had tried to interest AT&T in buying the technology, but the monopoly's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future. The financing was provided by Bolt, Beranack and Newman (BBN). It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29. These protocols were designed by Telenet and helped standardize them in the CCITT. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE.", "Some forms of civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft dodging, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive.

Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP, recording five solo tackles, 2\u00bd sacks, and two forced fumbles.", "The flora of the city may be considered very rich in species. The species richness is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas (natural forests, wetlands along the Vistula) as well as arable land, meadows and forests. Bielany Forest, located within the borders of Warsaw, is the remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest. Bielany Forest nature reserve is connected with Kampinos Forest. It is home to rich fauna and flora. Within the forest there are three cycling and walking trails. Other big forest area is Kabaty Forest by the southern city border.

Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1. Although (as series co-star Sophie Aldred reported in the documentary Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS) it was effectively, if not formally, cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.", "While in Limassol, Berengaria of Navarre, first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre, was married by Richard the Lion-Heart. Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily, attended the wedding that was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned King of Cyprus, and Berengaria Queen of England and Queen of Cyprus as well.", "\"The word \u2018empire\u2019 comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be \u2018sovereignty\u2019, or simply \u2018rule\u2019\". The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. Themselves are confined to the European seaborne empires by most books on the subject. European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.", "While most Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription, a prescription is not required by some Internet pharmacies that sell prescription drugs. Drugs are ordered by many customers from such pharmacies to avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. Especially those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication have criticized this practice as potentially dangerous. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.", "In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE). Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system \u2014 something for which Westinghouse had been trying to secure patents.

Residents were led to move to newer housing in the suburbs by the construction of highways. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, Jacksonville was left with a much poorer population than before by the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class \"white flight\".

If food is plentiful, 10 times their own weight per day can be eaten by them. While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) are incorporated into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts by members of the genus Haeckelia. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey \u2013 some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. The wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species is explained by this variety. Themselves are attached by juveniles of Lampea like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods are mainly captured by Pleurobrachia's long tentacles.", "In October 2010, a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998 was published by the open-access scientific journal PLoS Pathogens. The presence of DNA/RNA with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences was assessed by them. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \". . . ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\".", "On Carolina's next possession a fumble, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line, was lost by fullback Mike Tolbert while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart.

This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. The speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector, is not changed by such forces. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. Both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction, are yielded by this.", "Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as \"Constituency MSPs\". One member to represent the constituency is chosen by voters, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP.

Currently, 55,000 electors are comprised by the average Scottish Parliament constituency. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. A much smaller number of electors is comprised by the island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.

Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, some resemblance with ramification in geometry is borne by factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations", "The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region (at this point just constituency seats), the number of list votes cast for each party is divided. The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat. This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.", "On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal \u2013 and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.", "Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in his life, religious fanaticism was not opposed by him.

However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.", "A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament.

The mother provides several layers of passive protection. During pregnancy, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies are contained by breast milk or colostrum. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies\u2014it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.", "Methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure (e.g., \"St. James UMC\"). 1 Corinthians 11:1 is not the patient of the sentence, it seems to be part of a parenthetical remark. \nMethodists also honor notable heroes and heroines of the Christian faith and look to these prominent saints as providing examples of holy living and commitment to Christ that are worthy of imitation (see 1 Corinthians 11:1).\nIn this sentence, \"notable heroes and heroines of the Christian faith\" and \"these prominent saints\" and \"examples of holy living and commitment to Christ\" can be considered as patients.\nSo the output can be: \nNotable heroes and heroines of the Christian faith are honored by Methodists and these prominent saints are looked to by Methodists as providing examples of holy living and commitment to Christ that are worthy of imitation (see 1 Corinthians 11:1).\nOr \nExamples of holy living and commitment to Christ that are worthy of imitation are provided by these prominent saints and are looked to by Methodists (see 1 Corinthians 11:1).

Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.", "In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.

These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis.

The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.", "The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin.

A nervous breakdown was suffered by Nikola at around the same time.", "As of 2012, substantial tuition, close to $40,000 annually for day schools in New York City, and nearly $50,000 for boarding schools, was charged by quality private schools in the United States. However, operating expenses, particularly at boarding schools, were not covered by tuition. The leading schools such as the Groton School had substantial endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising drives. Boarding schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the country, indeed the globe, and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity.", "Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter. A correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom has been found by recent research. Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.", "Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.", "This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver are pitted against each other by the matchup. The record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks was set by Manning and Newton at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).", "The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne (popularly known as the 'Lit & Phil') is the largest independent library outside London, housing more than 150,000 books. 8000 CDs and 10,000 LPs are contained by its music library. John and Benjamin Green designed the building. Operating since 1793 and founded as a \u2018conversation club,\u2019 its lecture theatre was the first public building to be lit by electric light, during a lecture by Joseph Swan on 20 October 1880.", "One theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.", "Johnson's expedition was better organized than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil. He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Dieskau was sent to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat by Vaudreuil. It was attacked by Dieskau's Indian support. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).", "Between the 1880s and World War II, some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings were contained by Downtown Fresno, which flourished, filled with electric Street Cars. Among them, a few were named by the original Fresno County Courthouse (demolished), the Fresno Carnegie Public Library (demolished), the Fresno Water Tower, the Bank of Italy Building, the Pacific Southwest Building, the San Joaquin Light & Power Building (currently known as the Grand 1401), and the Hughes Hotel (burned down).", "In the helical thylakoid model, grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids can be contained by each granum, though grana with 10\u201320 thylakoids are most common. Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20\u201325\u00b0, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.", "Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.", "In front of the Presiding Officers' desk is the parliamentary mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the mace, which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, reinforcing the authority of the Parliament in its ability to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.", "Sizeable minorities of other faiths do exist (Muslim 11.2%, indigenous beliefs 1.7%), and nonreligious 2.4%. Sixty percent of the Muslim population lives in Kenya's Coastal Region, comprising 50% of the total population there. Roughly 4% of Muslims are Ahmadiyya, 8% Shia and another 8% are non-denominational Muslims, while 73% are Sunni. Western areas of the Coast Region are mostly Christian. The upper part of Kenya's Eastern Region is home to 10% of the country's Muslims, where they constitute the majority religious group. In addition, there is a large Hindu population in Kenya (around 300,000), who have played a key role in the local economy; they are mostly of Indian origin.", "Restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores, currently operating on or near Olive Avenue, and all within a few hundred feet of each other, are featured by the neighborhood.

The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field). Fully stated, this is the law:", "\"Southern California\" is not a formal geographic designation, and definitions of what constitutes southern California vary. Geographically, California's north-south midway point lies at exactly 37\u00b0 9' 58.23\" latitude, around 11 miles (18 km) south of San Jose; however, this does not coincide with popular use of the term. When the state is divided into two areas (northern and southern California), the term \"southern California\" usually refers to the ten southern-most counties of the state. This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35\u00b0 47\u2032 28\u2033 north latitude, which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties. Point Conception and the Tehachapi Mountains are used as the northern boundary by another definition for southern California.", "The Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. The town of Otrar was quickly seized by the Mongol army, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Molten silver was poured into his ears and eyes by Genghis Khan. Near the end of the battle the Shah fled rather than surrender. Subutai and Jebe were ordered by Genghis Khan to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.", "In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, this price drives inequality. Under the law of supply and demand, a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker determines the price of skill. On the other hand, workers and consumers can also be abused by markets, which can concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society. \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. The best of their labor will be taken advantage of by their competitors by offering a higher wage. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.", "The concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class is motivated by a problem. A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.", "Since the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.", "In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, sunlight was focused by an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" His findings were published by Priestley in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.", "Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" During the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. Civil disobedients have sometimes used the necessity defense as a shadow defense to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the jury was instructed to disregard his competing harms defense by the judge, and he was found guilty. Prosecution has escaped many of them because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\"", "For many geologic applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating are included by common methods. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Relative dating techniques can be calibrated by dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence which can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.", "Particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation frequently evoked Luther's hymns. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the hymn \"Ein neues Lied wir heben an\" (\"A new song we raise\"), which is generally known in English by John C.

Prior to and during World War I, marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential were dominated by the expansion engine. The British invention steam turbine however superseded it where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the dreadnought battleships, and ocean liners. HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.[citation needed]", "In the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, \"Walking Into Fresno\", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous \"WWVA Jamboree\" radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia.

His first TV appearance was made by Aken playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.", "Demographically, it was the most diverse city in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born inhabitants. In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, 219,000 (around 34% percent) was constituted by Jews. About 30 percent of the city's total population was constituted by Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. The demographics of the city were changed by World War II, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history.

Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi. It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the African Great Lakes region.

For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.", "Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN). Strictly speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well. It contributed to the confusion although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN.", "Organisms are protected by the immune system from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, the organism is prevented from entering by physical barriers. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, an immediate, but non-specific response is provided by the innate immune system. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response, is possessed by vertebrates. Here, its response during an infection is adapted by the immune system to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.", "According to Sheldon Ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties. The ozone case communicated to lay persons \"with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture\" and related to \"immediate risks with everyday relevance\", while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger. The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but a stronger argument was made by the Stern Review ordered by the UK government in favor to combat human-made climate change.", "Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The \"Hugues hypothesis\" argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. The Gallicans and Protestants regarded him as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.", "What system would Richard Dean Adams, who headed up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, seek Tesla's opinion on to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to utilize power generated by the falls with many systems being proposed by several US and European companies including two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and even compressed air. Tesla was pumped by Adams for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Adams was advised by Tesla that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. Based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration that they could build a complete AC system at the Columbian Exposition, a contract for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls was awarded Westinghouse Electric. A further contract to build the AC distribution system was awarded to General Electric.", "In southern Europe, the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP (million years before present). The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, direction was reversed by the two plates and they began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. The Pyrenees were pushed up by Iberia. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.", "An average of $5 million was charged by CBS for a 30-second commercial during the game, and Super Bowl 50 was broadcast by CBS in the U.S. The British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively, headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show.

The ABC logo first appeared as a on-screen bug in the 1993\u201394 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the 1995\u201396 season; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011\u201312 season.", "In World War II, it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies. The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, A Bridge Too Far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944. The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact \u2013 much to their own surprise \u2013 after the Germans failed to demolish it.

There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.", "Chemical barriers also protect against infection. Antimicrobial peptides such as the \u03b2-defensins are secreted by the skin and respiratory tract. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.

Phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide, keeping it from folding prematurely. This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place\u2014the cytosol. At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast. These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast.", "Six of the seven lines of the commuter rail system, Metrolink, run out of Downtown Los Angeles, connecting Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and San Diego counties with the other line connecting San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties directly.", "Its meaning is kept by the notion \"force\" in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation instead of Newtonian equations. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes \"quantized\", i.e. they appear in discrete portions.

The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. The need for a dedicated path is precluded by this, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number. Thus a transport layer protocol provides a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream, to the end-user, although intermediate network nodes only provide a connectionless network layer service.", "Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, stress is not detected, instead, molecules are produced, so the original sentence cannot be transformed into passive voice with 'stress' as the patient, the original sentence remains: After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so their signal is probably passed on by them to an unknown second messenger molecule. Retrograde signaling\u2014signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus was initiated by all these molecules.", "In 2014, work was completed on the stations historic entrance. Glazing was placed over the historic arches and the Victorian architecture was enhanced; transforming the 19th century public portico. The station is one of only six Grade One listed railway stations in the UK. Opened in 1850 by Queen Victoria, it was the first covered railway station in the world and was much copied across the UK. It has a neoclassical fa\u00e7ade, originally designed by the architect John Dobson, and was constructed in collaboration with Robert Stephenson. The station sightlines towards the Castle Keep, whilst showcasing the curvature of the station\u2019s arched roof. The North Eastern Railway company operated the first services. The city's other mainline station, Manors, is to the east of the city centre.", "Tem\u00fcjin was probably born in 1162 in Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog, near Burkhan Khaldun mountain and the Onon and Kherlen rivers in modern-day northern Mongolia, not far from the current capital Ulaanbaatar. The Secret History of the Mongols reports that Tem\u00fcjin was born with a blood clot grasped in his fist, a traditional sign that he was destined to become a great leader. He was the second-oldest son of his father Yes\u00fcgei, a Khamag Mongol's major chief of the Kiyad and an ally of Toghrul Khan of the Keraite tribe, and the oldest son of his mother Hoelun. According to the Secret History, Tem\u00fcjin was named after a Tatar chieftain, Tem\u00fcjin-\u00fcge, whom his father had just captured.", "The Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Ruhr area. Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr region. One of the most important cities in this region is Duisburg with the largest river port in Europe (Duisport). The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural. In Wesel, 30 km downstream of Duisburg, is located the western end of the second east-west shipping route, the Wesel-Datteln Canal, which runs parallel to the Lippe.

The war was fought between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the war, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. War was declared on each other by the metropole nations in 1756, escalating it from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.", "Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource. The Blum complexity axioms very generally define complexity measures. Communication complexity, circuit complexity, and decision tree complexity are included by other complexity measures used in complexity theory.", "Tesla was born on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 into a Serb family in the village of Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). His father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian Orthodox priest. Tesla's mother, \u0110uka Tesla (n\u00e9e Mandi\u0107), whose father was also an Orthodox priest,:10 had a talent for making home craft tools, mechanical appliances, and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. A formal education had never been received by \u0110uka. His eidetic memory and creative abilities were credited to his mother's genetics and influence by Nikola. Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.:12", "Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.", "Under the Scotland Act 1998, ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The Monarch may vary the date of the poll by up to one month either way on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, a date for an extraordinary general election is proposed by the Presiding Officer and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, a multiple of four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).", "Cultural imperialism is when a country's influence is felt in social and cultural circles, i.e. its soft power, such that it changes the moral, cultural and societal worldview of another. This is more than just \"foreign\" music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.", "After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named New Holland, under the administration of the colonial government in Sydney. The first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor David Collins at Sullivan Bay on Port Phillip. It consisted of 402 people (5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers' wives, and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts' wives, and 7 children). They had been sent from England in HMS Calcutta under the command of Captain Daniel Woodriff, principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent."], "answers": [["the force of gravity on an object", "force of gravity"], ["5 million"], ["any natural number n > 3", "> 3.", "n > 3"], ["90.20 K (\u2212182.95 \u00b0C, \u2212297.31 \u00b0F)", "90.20 K"], ["the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v.
