Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth. This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of  will experience a force:", "For a lengthy period, it was believed that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely inhabited, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through farming given the poor soil. Archaeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.", "are prime for any natural number n.

Both liquid and solid O2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid O2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air, using liquid nitrogen as a coolant. It is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.", "In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example would be WBAI's transmission the track \"Filthy Words\" from a George Carlin comedy album, which ultimately led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, Joseph Haas was arrested for allegedly sending an email to the Lebanon, New Hampshire city councilors stating, \"Wise up or die.\"", "In Marxist analysis, capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs (employees) under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits. Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the \"reserve army of labour\"). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.", "Outstanding examples of the upper-class architectural style of the later periods were not restored by the communist authorities after the conflict (like mentioned Kronenberg Palace and Insurance Company Rosja structure) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like Warsaw Philharmony edifice originally inspired by Palais Garnier in Paris).

Recent research has found a correlation between educator ardor and pupils' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom. Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college pupils has shown that nonverbal expressions of ardor, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college pupils reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.[citation needed]", "The concept ecological fatalism served as a moral rationale for domination of certain territories and peoples. It was believed that a certain person's actions were determined by the ecosystem in which they lived and thus validated their domination. For example, people living in tropical ecosystems were seen as \"less civilized\" therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission. Across the three waves of European colonialism (first in the Americas, second in Asia and lastly in Africa), ecological fatalism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality.", "A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.", "The principles of European Union law are rules of law which have been developed by the European Court of Justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how European Union law is interpreted and applies.

Accepted general principles of European Union Law include fundamental rights (see human rights), proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law and subsidiarity.", "During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Liquid on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west liquid flowed toward the Atlantic across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solim\u00f5es Basin. Within the last 5\u201310 million years, this accumulating liquid broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic.", "The most frequently utilized reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This signifies that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For instance, the problem of squaring a whole number can be reduced to the problem of [multiplying two integers]. This signifies an algorithm for [multiplying two integers] can be utilized to square a whole number. Indeed, this can be accomplished by providing the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we observe that squaring is not more challenging than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.", "All the background music for the 2005 revived series has been composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\" onwards.

David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Physician Who Concert was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Concerts. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time.

The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary boulders that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive boulders have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older boulders, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known boulder in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these procedures can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower boulder units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of boulder emplacement and boulder deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.", "Pharmaceutical data processing is the integration of pharmaceutical practice science and applied data science.

The symptoms of inflammation are rubescence, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.", "In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an investigation conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while inhaling it. After inhaling the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.

One of the roles of the associate is to remind the Doctor of his \"moral duty\". The Doctor's first associates seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin. Notable associates from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve.

Luther rarely encountered Hebrews during his life, but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Hebrews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Hebrews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Hebrews dogs, evildoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised kindness toward the Hebrews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Hebrew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity.

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.", "Plants have two main immune responses\u2014the hypersensitive response, in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death, and systemic acquired resistance, where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence. Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely harming their photosynthetic system, producing reactive oxygen species. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance, triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.", "The U.S. administration has undertaken initiatives to counter Islamism, or violent Islamism, since 2001. These initiatives were centred in the U.S. around public relations programmes conducted by the State Department. There have been calls to create an independent agency in the U.S. with a specific mission of undermining Islamism and jihadism. Christian Whiton, an official in the George W.

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for establishing something similar to the defunct U.S. Information Agency, which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the Cold War.", "Early in 1537, Johannes Agricola (1494\u20131566) \u2013 serving at the time as minister in Luther's birthplace, Eisleben \u2013 delivered a sermon in which he claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral legislation (the Ten Commandments), revealed God's wrath to Christians. Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian propositions circulating in Wittenberg. These propositions asserted that the legislation is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall. Luther responded to these propositions with six series of propositions against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for debates between 1538 and 1540. He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 open letter to C. G\u00fcttel Against the Antinomians, and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.", "Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of biotechnologically altered crops. Since, in most flowering organisms, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of biotechnologically altered organisms that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco organisms are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic organisms at 3 in 1,000,000.", "A constitutional amendment was considered that would eliminate the position of Prime Minister and simultaneously reduce the authorities of the President. A referendum to vote on the proposed constitution was held on 4 August 2010, and the new constitution passed by a wide margin.

High and persistent joblessness, in which disparity increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic expansion. Joblessness can harm expansion not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies aiming at controlling joblessness and in particular at reducing its disparity-associated effects support economic expansion.", "In late November 2015, reports emerged stating that \"multiple acts\" would perform during the halftime show.

In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints, Luther was presented as a stout man with a \"double chin, strong mouth, piercing deep-set eyes, fleshy face, and squat neck.\" He was shown to be physically imposing, an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism. His large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking\u2014behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders. Famous images from this period include the woodcuts by Hans Brosamer (1530) and Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger (1546).", "Other constituents are often present; pumps (such as an injector) to provide liquid to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the liquid and recover the latent heat of vaporisation, and superheaters to elevate the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes.

Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in size. Like cnidarians, their bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep. Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum, Coelenterata, as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration. Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla.", "In 2004, the V&A alongside Royal Institute of British Architects opened the first permanent exhibition in the UK covering the history of architecture with displays using models, photographs, elements from buildings and original designs. With the opening of the new exhibition, the RIBA Designs and Archives Collection has been transferred to the museum, joining the already extensive collection held by the V&A. With over 600,000 designs, over 750,000 papers and paraphernalia, and over 700,000 photographs from around the world, together they form the world's most comprehensive architectural resource.", "While photosystem II photolyzes water to acquire and energize new electrons, photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain. Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP+, though sometimes they can flow back down more H+-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is prevalent in C4 plants, which need more ATP than NADPH.", "Though John Wesley originally wanted the Methodists to remain within the Church of England, the American Revolution decisively separated the Methodists in the American colonies from the life and sacraments of the Anglican Church. In 1784, after unsuccessful attempts to have the Church of England send a bishop to start a new church in the colonies, Wesley decisively appointed fellow priest Thomas Coke as superintendent (bishop) to organize a separate Methodist Society. Together with Coke, Wesley sent a revision of the Anglican Prayerbook and the Articles of Religion which were received and adopted by the Baltimore Christmas Conference of 1784, officially establishing the Methodist Episcopal Church. The conference was held at the Lovely Lane Methodist Church, considered the Mother Church of American Methodism.", "Prohibited by the administration from settling in New France, Huguenots directed by Jess\u00e9 de Forest, sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later incorporated into New York and New Jersey); as well as Great Britain's colonies, including Nova Scotia. A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'\u00c9glise fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world. Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam, Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek, becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn, then known as Boschwick, in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick.", "The Super Bowl 50 Host Committee has vowed to be \"the most giving Super Bowl ever\", and will dedicate 25 percent of all money it raises for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area.

The packets include a link identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. The packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information, such as length, timestamp, or sequence number, which is different for different packets.", "In late 1886 Tesla encountered Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's patents and other ideas they agreed to back him financially and handle his patents. Together in April 1887 they formed the Tesla Electric Company with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go \u2153 to Tesla, \u2153 to Peck and Brown, and \u2153 to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators and other devices.", "On May 21, 2013, NFL proprietors at their spring gatherings in Boston voted and awarded the game to Levi's Stadium.

Shark Tank (based on the Dragon's Den reality format) also became a midseason sleeper hit on Sundays in the spring of 2010; the following season, it became the tentpole of the network's Friday night schedule, gradually helping make ABC a strong competitor (after being paired with 20/20 and beginning with the 2012\u201313 season, the Tim Allen sitcom Last Man Standing) against CBS' long-dominant drama/reality lineup on that night for the first time since the \"TGIF\" lineup ended in 2000.", "The annulment forbade Protestant services, required education of children as Catholics, and prohibited emigration. It proved disastrous to the Huguenots and costly for France. It precipitated civil bloodshed, ruined commerce, and resulted in the illegal flight from the country of hundreds of thousands of Protestants, many of whom became intellectuals, doctors and business leaders in Britain as well as Holland, Prussia, and South Africa. Four thousand emigrated to the North American colonies, where they settled in New York and Virginia, especially. The English welcomed the French refugees, providing money from both government and private agencies to aid their relocation. Those Huguenots who stayed in France became Catholics and were called \"new converts\".", "Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, put Tesla firmly on the \"AC\" side of the so-called \"War of Currents,\" an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888. This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.", "The swift English-French conquest proved more significant than it appeared. The island occupied a crucial tactical location on the maritime routes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not persist without assistance from the sea. Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the Knights Templar and it was subsequently acquired, in 1489, by Guy de Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom. It was only in 1489 that the Venetians gained full dominance of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the fall of Famagusta in 1571.", "Since its creation in 1269, the 'Phags-pa script, a unified script for spelling Mongolian, Tibetan, and Chinese languages, was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty. Most of the Emperors could not master written Chinese, but they could generally converse well in the language. The Mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with Mongol clans, the Onggirat, and the Ikeres, kept the imperial blood purely Mongol until the reign of Tugh Temur, whose mother was a Tangut concubine. The Mongol Emperors had built large palaces and pavilions, but some still continued to live as nomads at times. Nevertheless, a few other Yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities; an example is Tugh Temur (Emperor Wenzong), who wrote poetry, painted, read Chinese classical texts, and ordered the compilation of books.", "The second primary legislative body is the Council, which is composed of different ministers of the member states. The heads of government of member states also convene a \"European Council\" (a distinct body) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the 'necessary stimulus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities'. It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'advance its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bind the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus. TEU article 16(4) and TFEU article 238(3) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members (not votes) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU: currently this means around 74 per cent, or 260 of the 352 votes. This is critical during the legislative process.", "Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into resilient communications networks, first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.", "Following the Nice Accord, there was an attempt to reform the constitutional legislation of the European Union and make it more transparent; this would have also produced a single constitutional document. However, as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands, the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force. Instead, the Lisbon Treaty was enacted. Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty, but it was formally an amending treaty, and \u2013 though it significantly altered the existing treaties \u2013 it did not completely replace them.", "Investigation by Harvard economist Robert Barro, found that there is \"little overall connection between revenue disparity and rates of expansion and investment\". According to research by Barro in 1999 and 2000, high levels of disparity reduce expansion in relatively poor countries but encourage expansion in richer countries. An examination of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of disparity on expansion with lead times of five years or less, but no correlation after ten years. Examinations of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time, and a negative impact on the duration of expansion.", "In this work, one of his most emphatic statements on faith, he argued that every good deed designed to attract God's favor is a sin. All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: \"Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides.\"", "Around 1800 Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure vapor; Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802. These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications. Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the vapor engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.", "Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a territory and the native populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.", "Nonviolent resisters have chosen a range of diverse unlawful actions. Bedau writes, \"There is a whole class of actions, undertaken in the name of nonviolent resistance, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)...Such actions are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane...The remoteness of the connection between the nonviolent act and the objectionable law lays such actions open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\" Bedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic unlawful protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some nonviolent resisters, such as the proprietors of a variety of different illegal acts and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the U.S. Government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law.

The regulator could not actually maintain a set speed, because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The regulator was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this regulator were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. The regulator was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.", "Following their defeat in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching modifications, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.", "The United Methodist Church is organized into conventions.

Schooling, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this schooling, however, increases in schooling first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford a schooling, or choose not to pursue optional schooling, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of schooling leads directly to reduced incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, schooling raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.", "The 17th century Royal Ujazd\u00f3w Castle currently houses Center for Modern Art, with some permanent and temporary exhibitions, concerts, shows and creative workshops.

Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately resulted in quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave\u2013particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.[Note 4]", "The historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its \"duty\". The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs. Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.", "With Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this will be the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves.", "The area is home to about 2.5 million arthropod species, tens of thousands of flora, and some 2,000 birds and mammals.

After a prolonged blockade, during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese merchants fled, taking the epidemic by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north. Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.", "Super Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and teams. Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards (315 to 194) and initial downs (21 to 11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team. The previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained less than 200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. The Broncos' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks. Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl.

Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system, in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.", "Proportionality is acknowledged one of the universal principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s. According to the universal principle of proportionality the legitimacy of an action depends on whether it was suitable and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued. When there is a selection between several suitable measures the least onerous must be adopted, and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued. The principle of proportionality is also acknowledged in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, stating that \"any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty\".", "The Broncos' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296).

And still other civic nonconformists, being anarchists, don't believe in the legitimacy of any administration, and therefore see no need to accept penalty for a violation of criminal regulation that does not infringe the rights of others.", "A research by the Global Institute for Economic Development Studies at United Nations University reports that the most affluent 1% of adults alone possessed 40% of international possessions in the year 2000. The three most affluent people in the world possess more financial possessions than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined riches of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 most affluent individuals in the world have a combined riches equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the most affluent 1% possesses 46% of the world's riches; the 85 most affluent people, a small part of the most affluent 1%, possess about 0.7% of the human population's riches, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the most affluent 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now possess nearly half of the world's riches and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's riches is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose possessions each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 most affluent individuals possess as much riches as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net riches (adding up possessions and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"", "The 2010 United States Census reported that Fresno had an inhabitants of 494,665.

Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian propositions circulating in Wittenberg. These propositions asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall. Luther reacted to these propositions with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540. He also reacted to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 open letter to C. G\u00fcttel Against the Antinomians, and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.", "However, an issue arose regarding the courses taken by ABC and UPT. In 1950, Noble designated Robert Kintner to be ABC's chief while he himself served as its CEO, a position he would hold until his passing in 1958. Despite the promise of non-interference between ABC and UPT, Goldenson had to intervene in ABC's decisions because of financial difficulties and the FCC's long period of indecision. Goldenson added to the confusion when, in October 1954, he proposed a merger between UPT and the DuMont Television Network, which was also mired in financial trouble. As part of this merger, the network would have been renamed \"ABC-DuMont\" for five years, and DuMont would have received $5 million in cash, room on the schedule for existing DuMont programming, and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont Laboratories receivers. In addition, to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, it would have been required to sell either WABC-TV or DuMont owned-and-operated station WABD in the New York City market, as well as two other stations. The merged ABC-DuMont would have had the resources to compete with CBS and NBC.", "The game's media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as Super Bowl Opening Night.

Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for several large pharmacy management companies (primarily Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare and PharMerica). This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.", "In addition to arguing that the rodent population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, critics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via insects in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the genetic results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves. Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rodents before outbreaks of epidemic between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of insects; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague\u2014which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.", "Even before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with Wales.

In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.", "Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, requirement for a Scottish Parliament grew, in part because the administration of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part.

Gaining support from princes and officers in Northern China and some other parts of the dynasty, Khanbaliq-based Tugh Tem\u00fcr eventually won the conflict against Ragibagh known as the War of the Two Capitals. Afterwards, Tugh Tem\u00fcr abdicated in favour of his brother Kusala, who was backed by Chagatai Khan Eljigidey, and announced Khanbaliq's intent to welcome him. However, Kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with Tugh Tem\u00fcr. He was supposedly killed with poison by El Tem\u00fcr, and Tugh Tem\u00fcr then remounted the throne. Tugh Tem\u00fcr also managed to send delegates to the western Mongol khanates such as Golden Horde and Ilkhanate to be accepted as the suzerain of Mongol world. However, he was mainly a puppet of the powerful official El Tem\u00fcr during his latter three-year reign. El Tem\u00fcr purged pro-Kusala officials and brought power to warlords, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the dynasty.", "The interiors of the three refreshment rooms were assigned to different designers.

The lower part of the walls are panelled in wood with a band of paintings depicting fruit and the occasional figure, with moulded plaster foliage on the main part of the wall and a plaster frieze around the decorated ceiling and stained-glass windows by Edward Burne-Jones. The Centre Refreshment Room 1865\u201377 was designed in a Renaissance style by James Gamble, the walls and even the Ionic columns are covered in decorative and moulded ceramic tile, the ceiling consists of elaborate designs on enamelled metal sheets and matching stained-glass windows, the marble fireplace was designed and sculpted by Alfred Stevens and was removed from Dorchester House prior to that building's demolition in 1929. The Grill Room 1876\u201381 was designed by Sir Edward Poynter, the lower part of the walls consist of blue and white tiles with various figures and foliage enclosed by wood panelling, above there are large tiled scenes with figures depicting the four seasons and the twelve months these were painted by ladies from the Art School then based in the museum, the windows are also stained glass, there is an elaborate cast-iron grill still in place.", "Following the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene annihilation event, the annihilation of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical jungle to spread out across the continent. From 66\u201334 Mya, the jungle extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the jungle spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the jungle still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.", "Growth of the fertilized eggs is direct, in other words there is no distinctive larval form, and youngsters of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid grown-ups. In the genus Beroe the youngsters, like the grown-ups, lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths. In most species the youngsters gradually develop the body forms of their parents. In some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the youngsters behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the grown-up form by a more radical metamorphosis, after dropping to the sea-floor.", "In August 1227, during the decline of Yinchuan, the capital of Western Xia, Genghis Khan died. The exact cause of his death remains a mystery, and is variously attributed to being killed in action against the Western Xia, illness, falling from his horse, or wounds sustained in hunting or battle. According to The Secret History of the Mongols Genghis Khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury. He was already old and tired from his journeys. The Galician\u2013Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle, while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign. Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis' death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty. One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him, though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.", "North American Aviation won the contract to construct the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was initiated early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.", "Following the accord, King George III released the Imperial Declaration of 1763 on October 7, 1763, which outlined the partition and management of the newly acquired territory, and to some extent continues to regulate relations between the administration of modern Canada and the Indigenous Peoples. Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Native population, a demarcation that was at best a temporary obstacle to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers. The declaration also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians. When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues, religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of \"popery\"; the Act maintained French Civil law, including the seigneurial system, a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.", "A Pharmacy Technician in the UK is considered a medical care specialist and often does not work under the direct supervision of a pharmacist (if employed in a hospital pharmacy) but instead is supervised and managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT has grown and accountability has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialised areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialise in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. A pharmacy technician once qualified has to register as a professional on the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) register. The GPhC is the governing body for pharmacy health care professionals and this is who regulates the practice of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.", "Instruction may be carried out informally, within the family, which is called homeschooling, or in the wider community.

Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, resilient communications network. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.", "For many years, Sudan had a fundamentalist regime under the leadership of Hassan al-Turabi. His National Islamic Front first gained influence when strongman General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979. Turabi established a robust financial foundation with money from foreign Islamist banking systems, especially those linked with Saudi Arabia. He also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education.", "One computer simulation of future global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon jungle could become unviable under conditions of severely reduced precipitation and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of jungle cover in the basin by 2100. However, simulations of Amazon basin global warming across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any precipitation response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the jungle could be endangered though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.", "Seismologists can utilize the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to visualize the interior of the Earth. Early advances in this field demonstrated the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a stratified model of the Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the Earth, and have replaced the simplified stratified model with a much more dynamic model.", "A revamped variant of the ABC logo was unveiled for advertisements for the 2013\u201314 season during the system's upfront presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially unveiled on-air on June 17 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of a makeover of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar. The updated logo carries a simpler sheen design than the previous variant, and contains lettering more closely resembling Paul Rand's original variant of the circle logo. The logo is displayed on-air, online and in print advertisements in four variants shading the respective hue used with the circle design's native black coloring: a golden variant is primarily used on entertainment-oriented outlets (such as ABC.com, WATCH ABC, and by ABC Studios) and the on-screen bug; steel blue and dark grey variants are used primarily by ABC News; a crimson variant is used for ESPN on ABC, while all four variants are used selectively in advertisements and by affiliates.

Luther seldom interacted with Hebrews during his life, but his sentiments reflected a theological and cultural heritage which viewed Hebrews as a spurned people culpable of the assassination of Christ, and he lived within a local community that had banished Hebrews some ninety years earlier. He considered the Hebrews slanderers and deceivers because they declined to acknowledge the divinity of Jesus, whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah. But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally culpable. As early as 1516, he wrote that many people \"are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Hebrews canines, wrongdoers, or whatever they like, while they too, and equally, do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God\". In 1523, Luther advised benevolence toward the Hebrews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity. When his efforts at conversion failed, he grew increasingly bitter toward them.

Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the \"Empire of the Great Khan\" or \"Khanate of the Great Khan\", which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan. Nevertheless, both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan era by Kublai Khan in 1271.", "The first historical mention to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313, at a time when Krak\u00f3w served as the Polish capital metropolis. Due to its central location between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Krak\u00f3w and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).", "The economy of Victoria is highly varied: service sectors including fiscal and real estate services, wellness, learning, wholesale, retail, hospitality and manufacturing constitute the majority of employment. Victoria's total gross state product (GSP) is ranked second in Australia, although Victoria is ranked fourth in terms of GSP per capita because of its limited mining activity. Culturally, Melbourne is home to a number of museums, art galleries and theatres and is also described as the \"sporting capital of Australia\". The Melbourne Cricket Ground is the biggest arena in Australia, and the host of the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The ground is also considered the \"spiritual home\" of Australian cricket and Australian rules football, and hosts the grand final of the Australian Football League (AFL) each year, usually drawing crowds of over 95,000 people. Victoria includes eight public universities, with the oldest, the University of Melbourne, having been founded in 1853.", "However, in 1883\u201384 Germany began to construct a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific, before losing interest in expansionism. Historians have debated exactly why Germany made this sudden and short-lived move.[verification needed] Bismarck was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of German prestige. He was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders, his neighbors at Friedrichsruh. The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly, starting with German New Guinea in 1884.", "In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the instructor is an office in the Aaronic priesthood, generally conferred on young boys or recent converts, and has little in common with the \"spiritual guide\" archetype. The role of \"spiritual guide\" may be filled by many individuals in the LDS Church, often a trusted friend, who may hold any office, from Elder to Bishop, or no office at all. The emphasis on spiritual mentorship in the LDS Church is similar to that in the more \"low-church\" traditions of Protestantism, with a stronger emphasis placed on the husband and father of a family to provide spiritual guidance for all of his family, ideally in consultation with his wife, even if the husband is not a member of the LDS Church, based on interpretations of certain Biblical texts which proclaim the spiritual authority of husbands in marriage. Even Priesthood representatives are expected to defer to the father of the house when in his home. Further, additional spiritual guidance is offered by those holding the office of Patriarch, which is supposed by Latter-day Saints to grant certain gifts of the Spirit, such as the ability to prophesy, to its holders. This guidance is generally offered during a ceremony called the patriarchal blessing.", "Its districts of Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Riverside are the five most inhabited in the state and all are in the top 15 most inhabited districts in the United States.", "The earliest documented instances of collective civic noncompliance took place during the Roman Empire. Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem. In contemporary times, some activists who commit civic noncompliance as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favorable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of jail solidarity. There have also been many instances of solitary civic noncompliance, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.", "The steam engine contributed significantly to the evolution of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental calculations made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the evolution of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature. The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the evolution of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.", "The Panthers seemed poised to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play. But the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the uprights on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus' 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16\u20137 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball during the return, but Trevathan recovered it to enable Denver to keep possession.", "In early 2012, NFL Chief Roger Goodell stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl \"spectacular\" and that it would be \"an important game for us as a league\".", "The Soulages assortment of Italian and French Renaissance objects was acquired between 1859 and 1865, and includes several cassone. The John Jones Collection of French 18th-century art and furnishings was bequeathed to the museum in 1882, then valued at \u00a3250,000. One of the most important pieces in this assortment is a marquetry commode by the \u00e9b\u00e9niste Jean Henri Riesener dated c1780. Other signed pieces of furniture in the assortment include a bureau by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Oeben, a pair of pedestals with inlaid brass work by Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle, a commode by Bernard Vanrisamburgh and a work-table by Martin Carlin. Other 18th-century \u00e9b\u00e9nistes represented in the Museum assortment include Adam Weisweiler, David Roentgen, Gilles Joubert & Pierre Langlois. In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticized at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon collection of French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.", "In 1882, Tesla commenced working for the Continental Edison Company in France, designing and making enhancements to electrical apparatus. In June 1884, he relocated to New York City:57\u201360 where he was hired by Thomas Edison to work at his Edison Machine Works on Manhattan's lower east side. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving more difficult problems.", "There are concentrations of taverns, pubs and nightspots around the Bigg Market and the Quayside area of the city centre. There are many taverns on the Bigg Market, and other popular areas for nightlife are Collingwood Street, popularly referred to as the 'Diamond Strip' due to its concentration of high-end taverns, Neville Street, the Central Station area and Osborne Road in the Jesmond area of the city. In recent years \"The Gate\" has opened in the city centre, a new indoor complex consisting of taverns, upmarket clubs, restaurants and a 12-screen Empire multiplex cinema. Newcastle's gay scene - 'The Pink Triangle' - is centred on the Times Square area near the Centre for Life and has a variety of bars, caf\u00e9s and clubs.", "The first European to journey the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox. Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0\u20131250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.", "On the TV side, in September 1969, ABC initiated the Film of the Week, a weekly exhibition aimed at exploiting the increasing popularity of made-for-TV films since the early 1960s. The Film of the Week broadcast full-length cinematic films directed by such skilled filmmakers as Aaron Spelling, David Wolper and Steven Spielberg (the latter of whom gained early success through the exhibition for his 1971 film Duel) that were produced on an average budget of $400,000\u2013$450,000. Hits for the TV network during the late 1960s and early 1970s included The Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family.", "Every May since 1987, the Institution of Chicago has held the Institution of Chicago Treasure Hunt, in which large groups of pupils compete to acquire notoriously obscure objects from a list. Since 1963, the Celebration of the Arts (FOTA) takes over campus for 7\u201310 days of exhibitions and interactive creative pursuits. Every January, the institution holds a week-long winter festival, Kuviasungnerk/Kangeiko, which include early morning exercise routines and fitness workshops. The institution also annually holds a summer carnival and concert called Summer Breeze that hosts outside musicians, and is home to Doc Films, a student film society founded in 1932 that screens films nightly at the institution.

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24\u201310 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league stressed the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.", "The novel bureau of the Premier will have jurisdiction and influence to coordinate and oversee the responsibilities of the Administration and will be filled by an elected Representative who will be the chief of the party or coalition with majority members in Legislature.

Kenyan lawmakers unanimously approved a jurisdiction-sharing deal 18 March 2008, aimed at rescuing a country usually seen as one of the most stable and prosperous in Africa. The deal united Kibaki's PNU and Odinga's ODM together and heralded the formation of the grand coalition, in which the two political parties would share jurisdiction equally.", "Deforestation is the transformation of wooded areas to non-wooded areas. The primary sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human habitation and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the jungle's interior was highly restricted, and the jungle remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the settlers were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the decline of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of jungle are visible to the naked eye from outer space.", "On May 21, 2013, NFL executives at their spring gatherings in Boston voted and granted the event to Levi's Stadium.

Rev. Paul T. Stallsworth, president of the Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality said he \"had every reason to believe\" that anti-abortion delegates would have won a floor vote.", "The Saturn IB was an advanced version of the Saturn I. The S-IB initial stage increased the propulsion to 1,600,000 pounds-force (7,120 kN), and the subsequent stage replaced the S-IV with the S-IVB-200, powered by a single J-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce 200,000 lbf (890 kN) of thrust. A restartable version of the S-IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg) into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM. Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, \"AS\" indicating \"Apollo Saturn\" and the \"2\" indicating the subsequent member of the Saturn rocket family.", "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Amazonia; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a humid deciduous forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.

The Mongolian Empire practiced faith tolerance because Mongolian tradition had long held that faith was a private notion, and not subject to law or intervention.[citation needed] Sometime before the rise of Genghis Khan, Ong Khan, his guide and eventual rival, had converted to Nestorian Christianism. Various Mongolian tribes were Animist, Buddhist or Christian. Faith tolerance was thus a well established concept on the Asian steppe.", "Edward John Noble, the proprietor of Life Savers candy, drugstore chain Rexall and New York City radio station WMCA, acquired the network for $8 million. Due to FCC ownership rules, the transaction, which was to include the acquisition of three RCA stations by Noble, would require him to resell his station with the FCC's approval. The Commission authorized the transaction on October 12, 1943. Soon afterward, the Blue Network was acquired by the new company Noble founded, the American Broadcasting System. Noble subsequently acquired the rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944; its parent company adopted the corporate name American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

This means that for a closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative power acts on the system. The power, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.", "Doctor Who initially aired for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the initial broadcast, each weekly installment formed part of a narrative (or \"serial\") \u2014 usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired in 12 episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, \"Mission to the Unknown\", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the 10-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for 14 episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a storyline, such as season 8 being devoted to the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called The Master, season 16's quest for The Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian Trilogy.", "A building project is a complex web of agreements and other legal responsibilities, each of which all parties must carefully consider. An agreement is the exchange of a set of responsibilities between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The duration component in building means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the agreements must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the responsibilities set out. Agreements that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted agreements lead to confusion and collapse.", "In August 1999, ABC premiered a special series event, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, a game show based on the British program of the same title. Presented throughout its ABC tenure by Regis Philbin, the program became a major ratings success throughout its initial summer run, which led ABC to renew Millionaire as a regular series, returning on January 18, 2000. At its peak, the program aired as much as six nights a week. Buoyed by Millionaire, during the 1999\u20132000 season, ABC became the first network to move from third to first place in the ratings during a single television season.

An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen (see the filled \u03c0* orbitals in the diagram), orbitals that are of equal energy\u2014i.e., degenerate\u2014is a configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of the O 2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.[b] The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.", "Many Chinese people and Khitan deserted to the Mongols to battle against the Jin.

In 1938, the FCC initiated a series of inquiries into the practices of broadcasting networks and published its report on the transmission of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA relinquish control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the main broadcasting network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no authority over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for broadcasting stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.", "Most species are hermaphrodites\u2014a solitary organism can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.", "Big-scale building demands cooperation across numerous fields. A designer typically oversees the task, and a building supervisor, design expert, building expert or project supervisor monitors it. For the successful implementation of a project, effective planning is vital.

The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F. W. Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery. All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864\u201369. The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance, much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic, this north fa\u00e7ade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble & Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting: Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); Titian (painting); thus representing the range of the museums collections, Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Fa\u00e7ade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum, this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.", "There are three major types of stone: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The stone cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of stone, and magma. When a stone crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This stone can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary stone, or be turned into a metamorphic stone due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the stone which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary stone can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic stone due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary stone. Sedimentary stone may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic stone may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of stones may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.", "The association declared on October 16, 2012, that the two contenders were Sun Life Stadium and Levi's Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously organized the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last organized in 1985 (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home team 49ers. The Miami proposal depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations. However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami's chances.", "Other green spaces in the city include the Botanical Garden and the University Library garden.

As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Wars of Religion, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.", "Following the French monarchy's repeal of the Edict of Nantes, many Huguenots relocated to the Emerald Isle in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by a statute of legislature for Protestants' relocation to the Emerald Isle. Huguenot battalions fought for William of Orange in the Williamite conflict in the Emerald Isle, for which they were rewarded with land concessions and titles, many relocating to Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal. Notable Huguenot colonies were in Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal. Smaller colonies, which included Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax farming and the growth of the Emerald Isle textile industry.", "Educators are required to be enrolled with the Teaching Council; under Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, a person employed in any capacity in a recognised teaching post - who is not enrolled with the Teaching Council - may not be paid from Oireachtas funds.", "ABC's daytime schedule currently features conversation shows The View and The Chew, and the soap opera General Hospital, the latter of which is the longest-running entertainment program in the history of the ABC television network, having aired since 1963.

Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.", "The Sultan's military was divided by varied internal conflicts and by the Sultan's decision to split his military into minor units concentrated in various metropolises. This disintegration was crucial in Khwarezmia's losses, as it permitted the Mongols, although fatigued from the lengthy voyage, to instantly commence defeating minor portions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of confronting a unified resistance. The Mongol military rapidly captured the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan commanded the wholesale slaughter of many of the civilians, enslaved the remainder of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retaliation for his actions. Near the conclusion of the battle the Sultan fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan commanded Subutai and Jebe to pursue him, giving them 20,000 men and two years to accomplish this. The Sultan died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.", "The basic theorem of arithmetic persists to hold in distinctive decomposition realms. An illustration of such a realm is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers.

Bowman was the director of the American Geographical Society in 1914. Three years later in 1917, he was appointed to then President Woodrow Wilson's investigation in 1917. The investigation was the idea of President Wilson and the American delegation from the Paris Peace Conference. The point of this investigation was to build a premise that would allow for U.S authorship of a 'new world' which was to be characterized by geographical order. As a result of his role in the investigation, Isiah Bowman would come to be known as Wilson's cartographer.", "On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his 200 power units (150 kilowatts) 16,000 revolutions per minute bladeless generator.

Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross-sectional data. However, more recent examination of this hypothesis with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s. This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' hypothesis.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.", "The characteristic of being prime (or not) is called primality. A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division. It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and . Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers. These include the Miller\u2013Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small probability of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers.

Genghis Khan saw the potential benefit in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road, and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire. However, Inalchuq, the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a plot against Khwarezmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq. The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 tumens), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed \u00d6gedei to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarezmia.", "Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The \"Hugues hypothesis\" argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicans and Protestants as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.", "Elongation causes the geological formations as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile extending and thinning. Normal faults drop geological formations that are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger formations being placed below older formations. Elongation of formations can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Geological formations at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These extended geological formations can also constrict into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for \"sausage\", because of their visual similarity.", "During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passion for (and became very proficient at) pool, chess and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.:43, 301 On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.:208 Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept.

Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that \"the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption disparity has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income disparity,\" and expenditure is more important than income. According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption disparity was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. The debate is summarized in \"The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor\" by journalist Thomas B. Edsall. Other studies have not found consumption disparity less dramatic than household income disparity, and the CBO's study found consumption data not \"adequately\" capturing \"consumption by high-income households\" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.", "Another significant repository \u2013 the University Library, established in 1816, is home to over two million items.

However, these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.[citation needed] Since electrons are fermions, they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons. When the electrons in a material are densely packed together, there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all, so some of them must be in higher energy states. This means that it takes energy to pack them together. While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force, it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.", "It was not until January 1518 that acquaintances of Luther translated the 95 Dissertations from Latin into German and printed and widely duplicated them, making the controversy one of the first in history to be aided by the printing press.

Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that precipitation in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced humid tropical flora cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the jungle was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the jungle remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the jungle mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.", "With Istanbul as its metropolis and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries. Following a long period of military reverses against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined into the late nineteenth century. The empire allied with Germany in the early 20th century, with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of World War I, leading to the emergence of the new state of Turkey in the Ottoman Anatolian heartland, as well as the creation of modern Balkan and Middle Eastern states, thus ending Turkish colonial ambitions.", "In 1998, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white \"ABC Circle\" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup).

They were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than chromalveolates. The apicomplexans include Plasmodium, the malaria parasite. Many apicomplexans keep a residual red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast, which they inherited from their ancestors. Other apicomplexans like Cryptosporidium have lost the chloroplast completely.

The pact aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing supremacy in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its supremacy had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the pact banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional pact and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on corporations were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on acquisitions were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.", "On June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for upcoming 2007\u201308 season, \"Start Here\".

New athletes gained attention, such as Pamela Jelimo, the women's 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the IAAF Golden League jackpot, and Samuel Wanjiru who won the men's marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kipchoge Keino helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion Henry Rono's spectacular string of world record performances. Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the desertion of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly Bahrain and Qatar. The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the desertions, but they have continued anyway, with Bernard Lagat the latest, choosing to represent the United States. Most of these desertions happen because of economic or financial factors. Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.[citation needed]", "Some chloroplasts contain a structure called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum. It is often found in the chloroplasts of C4 plants, though it has also been found in some C3 angiosperms, and even some gymnosperms. The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast. Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm. The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.", "Six score releases have been issued since 2005.

The commander of the Jin dynasty army made a strategic error in not attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity. Instead, the Jin commander sent a messenger, Ming-Tan, to the Mongol side, who defected and told the Mongols that the Jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass. At this engagement fought at Badger Pass the Mongols massacred hundreds of thousands of Jin troops. In 1215 Genghis besieged, captured, and sacked the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day Beijing). This forced the Emperor Xuanzong to move his capital south to Kaifeng, abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the Mongols.

Disney stakeholders approved the amalgamation at a special gathering in New York City on January 4, 1996, with the takeover of Capital Cities/ABC being finalized on February 9; following the transaction, Disney rebranded its new subsidiary ABC Inc. In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition incorporated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% stake in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment; and Capital Cities/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company. As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from retaining both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million. On April 4, Disney sold the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for $1.65 billion. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO. Around the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as Home Improvement and Boy Meets World, while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block. In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom Sports Night, centering on the tribulations of the staff of a SportsCenter-style sports news program; despite earning critical acclaim and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.", "Continuing the style of the earlier edifices, various designers were responsible for the ornamentation, the terracotta embellishments were again the work of Godfrey Sykes, although sgraffito was used to decorate the eastern edge of the building designed by F. W. Moody, a final ornamentation were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner, these lead to a passage through the building. Scott also designed the two Cast Courts 1870\u201373 to the southeast of the garden (the site of the \"Brompton Boilers\"), these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet (21 m) in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous edifices, including Trajan's Column (in two separate pieces). The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the southern edge of the garden, built 1877\u201383, the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library, Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases, also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting. This completed the northern half of the site, creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre, but left the museum without a proper fa\u00e7ade. In 1890 the government launched a competition to design new buildings for the museum, with architect Alfred Waterhouse as one of the judges; this would give the museum a new imposing front entrance.", "Whilst the permanent building at Holyrood was being constructed, the Legislature's temporary home was the General Convention Hall of the Church of Scotland on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the Convention Hall, which is part of the School of Theology of the University of Edinburgh. This building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the Church's General Convention.

The complete motor cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two cylinder movements; the cycle also comprises four events \u2013 admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a vapor chest adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the vapor by opening and closing vapor ports communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, of which there are many types.[citation needed]", "The Tech Coast is a nickname that has gained use as a descriptor for the region's diversified technology and industrial base as well as its multitude of prestigious and world-renowned research universities and other public and private institutions.

Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that \"it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force.\" British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America \"might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries,\" and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned \"the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the \u2018total alienation\u2019 of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World\",", "BSkyB's direct-to-home satellite service became available in 10 million homes in 2010, Europe's first pay-TV platform in to achieve that milestone.

Tem\u00fcjin grew up observing the tough political climate of Mongolia, which included tribal warfare, thievery, raids, corruption, and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations, all compounded by interference from external powers such as the Chinese dynasties to the south. Tem\u00fcjin's mother Hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of Mongolia, especially the need for alliances.", "Aristotle provided a theoretical examination of the concept of a power as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different \"organic locations\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their organic location on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"organic location\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"organic motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a power. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a power needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.", "Martin Luther wed Katharina von Bora, one of 12 nuns he had helped escape from the Nimbschen Cistercian convent in April 1523, when he arranged for them to be smuggled out in herring barrels. \"Suddenly, and while I was occupied with far different thoughts,\" he wrote to Wenceslaus Link, \"the Lord has plunged me into marriage.\" At the time of their marriage, Katharina was 26 years old and Luther was 41 years old.", "On March 17, 1752, the Administrator-General of New France, Marquis de la Jonqui\u00e8re, died and was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. His permanent replacement, the Marquis Duquesne, did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post. The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la Marine. Langlade was given 300 men, including French-Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa. His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following C\u00e9loron's orders to cease trading with the British. On June 21, the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany, capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the Miami nation, including Old Briton.

In 1901, Sir George Donaldson donated several pieces of art Nouveau furniture to the museum, which he had acquired the previous year at the Paris Exposition Universelle. This was criticized at the time, with the result that the museum ceased to collect contemporary items and did not do so again until the 1960s. In 1986 the Lady Abingdon collection of French Empire furniture was bequeathed by Mrs T. R. P. Hole.", "Despite his triumph in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to suppress extremism further afield. Clergymen such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas M\u00fcntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524\u201325, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name. There had been uprisings by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with \"liberal\" phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general. Uprisings broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as M\u00fcntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the uprisings turned into war.", "In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers) the workers wages will not be regulated by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the economy. wages work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of economy price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. \"On the other hand, economies can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers.\" \"Economies, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below economy wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above economy wages to workers.", "In the Sandgate area, to the east of the city and beside the river, resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families. They were so called because they worked on the keels, boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers, for export to London and elsewhere. In the 1630s about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague, more than one-third of the population. Specifically within the year 1636, it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the Society of Antiquaries that 47% of the then population of Newcastle died from the outbreak; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any British City in this period.", "Ctenophores constitute an animal phylum that is more intricate than sponges, about as intricate as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less intricate than bilaterians (which include almost all other creatures). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians possess: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some possess sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other creatures by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.", "The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a mortality rate of about a third. The Black Death slew about 40% of Egypt's inhabitants. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110\u2013120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.", "In terms of housing stock, the authority is one of few authorities to see the ratio of detached homes rise in the 2010 Census (to 7.8%), in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments to 25.6%, and the ratio of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five colour-coded brackets at 5.9%, and on a par with Oxford and Reading, greater than Manchester and Liverpool and below a handful of historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities: Harrogate, Cheltenham, Bath, inner London, Hastings, Brighton and Tunbridge Wells.", "Lake Constance comprises three bodies of water: the Obersee (\"upper lake\"), the Untersee (\"lower lake\"), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein (\"Lake Rhine\").

He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds, but his decision to marry surprised many, not least Melanchthon, who called it reckless. Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, \"I shall never take a spouse, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic.\" Before marrying, Luther had been living on the plainest food, and, as he admitted himself, his mildewed bed was not properly made for months at a time.", "Luther and his spouse relocated into a former convent, \"The Black Cloister,\" a wedding gift from the new elector John the Resolute (1525\u201332).

With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad. Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network.

Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive reaction, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive reaction used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.", "The metropolis has an extensive neoclassical hub referred to as Tyneside Classical largely developed in the 1830s by Richard Grainger and John Dobson, and recently extensively renovated.

Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools. Student uniforms for Australian independent schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer.

According to Kuznets, countries with low levels of growth have relatively equal distributions of riches. As a country grows, it acquires more capital, which leads to the owners of this capital having more riches and income and introducing disparity. Eventually, through various possible 'redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs', more developed countries move back to lesser levels of disparity.", "Since 1974, ABC has generally broadcast Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on New Year's Eve (hosted first by its creator Dick Clark, and later by his successor Ryan Seacrest); the only exception was in 1999, when ABC put it on a one-year hiatus to provide coverage of the international millennium festivities, though Clark's traditional countdown from Times Square was still featured within the coverage.

The core is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest modifications, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve modifications, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, laws can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while within the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.", "Luther empathised with some of the peasants' complaints, as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525, but he reminded the aggrieved to comply with the temporal authorities.

Their contents include a large collection of drawings and references to the equestrian sculpture commissioned by the Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza to commemorate his father Francesco Sforza. These were bequeathed with over 18,000 volumes to the museum in 1876 by John Forster. The Reverend Alexander Dyce was another benefactor of the repository, leaving over 14,000 volumes to the museum in 1869.

Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations.

The Tribunal has required that higher education, along with other forms of vocational training, should be more accessible, albeit with qualifying periods. In Commission v Austria the Tribunal held that Austria was not entitled to restrict places in Austrian universities to Austrian students to avoid \"structural, staffing and financial problems\" if (mainly German) foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem.", "The incursions of Baghdad, Samarkand, Urgench, Kiev, Vladimir among others caused mass killings, such as when portions of southern Khuzestan were completely devastated.

Once successfully completed, \"Provisional Registration\" is given by the GTCS which is raised to \"Full Registration\" status after a year if there is sufficient evidence to show that the \"Standard for Full Registration\" has been met.", "There are various mechanisms by which instructor passion may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation. Instructor passion may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter. Passionate instructors may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process. The concept of mere exposure indicates that the instructor's passion may contribute to the student's expectations about intrinsic motivation in the context of learning. Also, passion may act as a \"motivational embellishment\"; increasing a student's interest by the variety, novelty, and surprise of the passionate instructor's presentation of the material. Finally, the concept of emotional contagion, may also apply. Students may become more intrinsically motivated by catching onto the passion and energy of the instructor.[citation needed]", "The metropolis developed around the Roman settlement Pons Aelius and was named after the fortress built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, William the Conqueror's eldest son. The metropolis grew as an important centre for the textile trade in the 14th century, and later became a major coal mining area. The harbor developed in the 16th century and, along with the shipyards lower down the River Tyne, was amongst the world's largest shipbuilding and ship-repairing centres.

The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion.

Salaries work in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, salaries can be considered as a function of economy price of expertise. And therefore, disparity is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of expertise is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. \"On the other hand, markets can also accumulate riches, transfer ecological expenses on to community, and exploit laborers and customers.\" \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of disparity, outcomes that are widely viewed as unjust.\" Employers who offer a below economy wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above economy wages to laborers.", "To further emphasize the distinction between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities?

The stone cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of stone, and magma. When a stone crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous stone. This stone can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary stone, or be turned into a metamorphic stone due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the stone which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary stone can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic stone due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary stone. Sedimentary stone may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic stone may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of stones may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous stone may once again crystallize.", "The carpet collection includes a fragment of the Cloth of St Gereon, the oldest known surviving European carpet.

This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office.", "There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. The stone cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock, and magma. When a stone crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava), it is an igneous rock. This stone can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the stone which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock. Sedimentary rock may also be re-eroded and redeposited, and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism. All three types of rocks may be re-melted; when this happens, a new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.", "The 1960s would be characterized by the emergence of family-oriented series in an attempt by ABC to counterprogram its established competitors, but the decade was also marked by the network's gradual transition to color. On September 30, 1960, ABC launched The Flintstones, another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black-and-white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time. The Flintstones allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.", "Since its establishment, the Treaties sought to enable individuals to pursue their life goals in any country through unrestricted movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon unrestricted movement of employees: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Unrestricted movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that individuals had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"employee\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, an \"employee\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as an employee. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"employee\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, unrestricted movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically \"all available research finds little impact\" of \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\".", "Korean economist Hoesung Lee is the president of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the selection of the new IPCC Bureau.

The travel sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and by the late 1980s had become the country's principal source of foreign exchange. Travelers, the largest number being from Germany and the United Kingdom, are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves, notably, the expansive East and West Tsavo National Park 20,808 square kilometres (8,034 sq mi) in the southeast. Travel has seen a substantial revival over the past several years and is the major contributor to the pick-up in the country's economic growth. Travel is now Kenya's largest foreign exchange earning sector, followed by flowers, tea, and coffee. In 2006 travel generated US$803 million, up from US$699 million the previous year. Presently, there are also numerous Shopping Malls in Kenya. In addition, there are four main hypermarket chains in Kenya.", "The Apollo space travelers were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans. Dr. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the Apollo landing crews.", "The first Methodist clergy were consecrated by John Wesley, a priest of the Church of England, because of the crisis caused by the American Revolution which isolated the Methodists in the States from the Church of England and its sacraments. Today, the clergy includes men and women who are consecrated by bishops as elders and deacons and are appointed to various ministries. Elders in the United Methodist Church itenerate and are subject to the authority and appointment of their bishops. They generally serve as pastors in local congregations. Deacons are in service ministry and may serve as musicians, liturgists, educators, business administrators, and a number of other areas. Elders and deacons are required to obtain a master's degree (generally an M.Div.), or another equivalent degree, before commissioning and then ultimately consecration. Elders in full connection are each a member of their Annual Conference Order of Elders. Likewise each deacon in full connection is a member of their Annual Conference Order of Deacons.", "Youth exploitation is common in Kenya. Most working youths are active in farming. In 2006, UNICEF estimated that up to 30% of females in the coastal areas of Malindi, Mombasa, Kilifi, and Diani were subject to prostitution. Most of the sex workers in Kenya are aged 9\u201318. The Ministry of Gender and Child Affairs employed 400 child protection officers in 2009.

The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost. The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).", "Spiritual and theological instructors, such as mentors, clerics, rabbis, ministers/youth ministers and lamas, may teach sacred texts such as the Quran, Torah or Bible.", "Following guidelines set in the National Cycling strategy, Newcastle first developed its Cycling strategy in 1998.

The invasion failed both militarily and politically, as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France, and sent funds to Britain's ally on the mainland, Prussia, and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay. In one piece of good fortune, some French supply ships managed to depart France, eluding the British blockade of the French coast.", "In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter Tesla postulated that electricity could be utilized to locate submarines via using the reflection of an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency,\" with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water but \u00c9mile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating \"(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly.\":266", "In ring theory, the concept of number is generally replaced with that of ideal.

Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for microorganisms, but can be summoned to specific locations by cytokines. Once a microorganism has been ingested by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The microorganism is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include ingestion of microorganisms as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.", "Despite releasing longtime rusher DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their greatest ordinary season in franchise history, becoming the seventh squad to win at least 15 ordinary season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. Carolina started the season 14\u20130, not only setting franchise records for the greatest beginning and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the greatest beginning to a season by an NFC squad in NFL history, breaking the 13\u20130 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers.

If the water level decreases, such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, the lead melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.[citation needed]", "Baran created the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his investigation at the RAND Corporation for the US Aviation Service into survivable communications networks, first presented to the Aviation Service in the summer of 1961 as briefing B-265, later published as RAND report P-2626 in 1962, and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964. Report P-2626 described a general architecture for a large-scale, distributed, survivable communications network. The work focuses on three key ideas: use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points, dividing user messages into message blocks, later called packets, and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.", "Luther's 1538 melodic adaptation of the Lord's Prayer, \"Vater unser im Himmelreich\", corresponds exactly to Luther's interpretation of the prayer in the Small Catechism, with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions, plus opening and closing stanzas. The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lord's Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions. The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions, demonstrating Luther's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune. Other 16th- and 20th-century versifications of the Lord's Prayer have adopted Luther's tune, although modern texts are considerably shorter.", "During the 20th century, historians John Gallagher (1919\u20131980) and Ronald Robinson (1920\u20131999) constructed a framework for understanding European colonialism. They claim that European colonialism was influential, and Europeans rejected the notion that \"colonialism\" required formal, legal control by one government over another country. \"In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'\"[attribution needed] Because of the resources made available by colonialism, the world's economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I, making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.", "In the first half of the 17th century, a pestilence claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population. In 1656, the pestilence killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of pestilence in 17th-century Spain. The pestilence of 1649 probably reduced the population of Seville by half. In 1709\u201313, a pestilence epidemic that followed the Great Northern War (1700\u201321, Sweden v.

By liquefying the fluid, the energy required by the compressor consumes only 1% to 3% of the generator energy and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas generators, for instance, have generator entry temperatures approaching 1500 \u00b0C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas generators are fairly well matched.[citation needed]", "Instruction in Canada requires a post-secondary diploma Bachelor's Degree.

For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be peaceful noncompliance, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.", "The goal is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to education, including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills, knowledge and/or thinking skills. Different ways to instruct are often referred to as pedagogy. When deciding what instructional method to use educators consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curricula as determined by the relevant authority. Many times, educators assist in education outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips. The increasing use of technology, specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade, has begun to shape the way educators approach their roles in the classroom.", "One of the more unusual compilations is that of Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of Fauna Movement of 1887, this consists of 781 plates.

Many species, however, utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique protection mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.", "Using scalding water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical.

Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as warmth or a flame, is needed to trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion. Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a blaze.", "If flowering plant shoots are not exposed to the required illumination for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts. An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll, and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a prolamellar body. While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked. Within a few minutes of illumination exposure, the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced. This process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast, takes several hours. Conifers do not require illumination to form chloroplasts.", "Currently confinement is one of the most common penalties in schools in the United States, the UK, Ireland, Singapore and other countries. It requires the student to remain in school at a given time in the school day (such as lunch, recess or after school); or even to attend school on a non-school day, e.g. \"Saturday confinement\" held at some schools. During confinement, students normally have to sit in a classroom and do work, write lines or a penalty essay, or sit quietly.", "Approximately one million Protestants in contemporary France represent some 2% of its population.

The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.", "Luther's Small Catechism proved especially effective in helping parents instruct their children; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for pastors. Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life. That is, Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known. The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father. Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and the Lord's Prayer, which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching.", "After leaving Edison's firm Tesla collaborated with two entrepreneurs in 1886, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to fund an electrical illumination company in Tesla's name, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. The company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by Tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.", "During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's engine), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction engine could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.", "Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.", "From the demise of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic boundary the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this boundary, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily traversed. The boundary which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg.

In 1896, the university partnered with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the partnership, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from a partnered school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of a partnered school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend a partnered school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide partnered schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the partnership on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.", "The Mongolian forces under Genghis Khan, commanders and his sons crossed the Tien Shan mountains by entering the territory controlled by the Khwarezmian Empire. After gathering information from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his forces, which was divided into three groups. His son Jochi led the first division into the northeast of Khwarezmia. The second division under Jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarezmia to form, with the first division, a encirclement attack on Samarkand. The third division under Genghis Khan and Tolui marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarezmia from that direction.", "Oxygen is a chemical constituent with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most constituents. By mass, oxygen is the third-most plentiful constituent in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the constituent bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O 2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most plentiful constituent by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.", "Despite the high rank given to Muslims, some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely prejudiced against them, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision, as well as Kosher butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"garrison\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.", "Curiously, around half of the polypeptide products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the plastid. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cellular division, polypeptide routing, and even disease immunity. A few plastid genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome\u2014most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred plastid DNA polypeptide products get directed to the secretory pathway (though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the plastid from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space. In those cases, plastid-targeted polypeptides do initially travel along the secretory pathway)", "UK scholars Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have discovered higher rates of wellness and societal issues (obesity, mental illness, homicides, teenage births, incarceration, child conflict, substance abuse), and lower rates of societal benefits (life expectancy by country, academic performance, trust among strangers, women's status, social mobility, even numbers of patents issued) in nations and states with higher disparity. Using data from 23 industrialized nations and the 50 states of the US, they found social/wellness problems lower in nations like Japan and Finland and states like Utah and New Hampshire with high levels of equality, than in nations (US and UK) and states (Mississippi and New York) with large differences in household income.", "Fresno is characterized by a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSh), with moderate, humid winters and hot and dry summers, thus displaying Mediterranean characteristics. December and January are the chilliest months, and average around 46.5 \u00b0F (8.1 \u00b0C), and there are 14 nights with freezing lows annually, with the chilliest night of the year typically bottoming out below 30 \u00b0F (\u22121.1 \u00b0C). July is the hottest month, averaging 83.0 \u00b0F (28.3 \u00b0C); normally, there are 32 days of 100 \u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C)+ highs and 106 days of 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C)+ highs, and in July and August, there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C). Summers provide considerable sunshine, with July peaking at 97 percent of the total possible sunlight hours; conversely, January is the lowest with only 46 percent of the daylight time in sunlight because of thick tule fog. However, the year averages 81% of possible sunshine, for a total of 3550 hours. Average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches (292.1 mm), which, by definition, would classify the area as a semidesert. Most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest, as winds are driven downward along the axis of the California Central Valley; in December, January and February there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics.

The French musician Olivier Messiaen used prime numbers to create arrhythmic music through \"natural phenomena\". In works such as La Nativit\u00e9 du Seigneur (1935) and Quatre \u00e9tudes de rythme (1949\u201350), he simultaneously employs themes with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms: the primes 41, 43, 47 and 53 appear in the third \u00e9tude, \"Neumes rythmiques\". According to Messiaen this way of composing was \"inspired by the movements of nature, movements of free and unequal durations\".", "With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it, Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism. Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24\u201310 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina had two more drives, but failed to get a first down on each one.", "The Regal Geographic Society of London and other geographic societies in Europe had huge impact and were able to fund voyagers who would come back with tales of their findings. These societies also served as a space for voyagers to share these stories. Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported colonialism. Ratzel believed growth was necessary for a state\u2019s survival while Mackinder supported Britain\u2019s imperial expansion; these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades.", "In the late 17th century, Robert Boyle demonstrated that oxygen is necessary for burning. English chemical scientist John Mayow (1641\u20131679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of oxygen that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus. In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the oxygen's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both breathing and burning.", "In instruction, teachers facilitate student learning, often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors. An educator who teaches on an individual basis may be described as a tutor.", "The first European to journey the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex culture was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the culture was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe, such as smallpox. Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0\u20131250, furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations. Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre. The BBC's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.", "In 2004, declassified documents revealed that the U.S. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973. Although no explicit plan was mentioned, a conversation between U.S. Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that \"it was no longer obvious to him that the U.S. could not use force.\" British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of U.S. intentions, which concluded America \"might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the U.S. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries,\" and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon. Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force, intelligence warned \"the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources, and would result in the \u2018total alienation\u2019 of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World.\"", "By the commencement of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the U.S. and 3.5 million abroad. Notably, about 20% of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10%. During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the admission of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination. Given current trends in the UMC\u2014with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and U.S. churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week\u2014it has been estimated that Africans will make up at least 30% of the delegates at the 2012 General Conference, and it is also possible that 40% of the delegates will be from outside the U.S. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States.", "Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving. Extended inhalation of an air mixture with an O2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure to a O2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by inhaling an air mixture with 21% O2 at 66 m or more of depth; the same thing can occur by inhaling 100% O2 at only 6 m.", "On May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring gatherings in Boston voted and awarded the game to Levi's Stadium.

The section of Huntington Boulevard between First Street on the west to Cedar Avenue on the east is the home to many large, stately residences. The original development of this area began circa 1910, on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field. The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 residences. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital.", "In 1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS. In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.", "In early 2009, Disney\u2013ABC Television Group merged ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios into a novel division, ABC Entertainment Group, which would be responsible for both its production and transmission operations.

As the First Intifada gathered momentum and Palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising, the Brotherhood announced the formation of HAMAS (\"fervor\"), devoted to Jihad against Israel. Rather than being more moderate than the PLO, the 1988 Hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in Palestine. It was soon competing with and then overtaking the PLO for control of the intifada. The Brotherhood's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab.", "In Europe, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.", "Tesla claimed to have devised his own scientific principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"kinetic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space.\" He stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world. Further clarification of his theory was never found in his writings.:309", "The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".", "In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new districts: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt. By 1700, one-fifth of the city's population was French speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07. Many of their descendants rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded, such as those of Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.", "The backers showed little interest in Tesla's concepts for new types of engines and electrical transmission gear and also seemed to think it was better to develop an electrical utility than invent new systems. They eventually ousted Tesla out leaving him penniless. He even lost control of the patents he had generated since he had assigned them to the company in lieu of stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and even as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Tesla considered the winter of 1886/1887 as a time of \"terrible headaches and bitter tears.\" During this time, he questioned the value of his education.", "Southwestern California comprises the heavily developed metropolitan region stretching along the Pacific coastline from Ventura, through the Larger Los Angeles Region and the Inland Empire, and down to Larger San Diego.

First, during the early slow-wave-somnolence stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune reaction). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune recollection through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.", "ABC currently holds the transmission rights to the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards (which are rotated across all four major networks on a year-to-year basis), American Music Awards, Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade, Tournament of Roses Parade, Country Music Association Awards and the CMA Music Festival.

The programme has substituted all ticket machines and introduced ticket gates at the busiest stations - part of the transition to smart ticketing. All Metro trains are being completely renovated and most stations are undergoing improvement works (or in some cases complete reconstruction, for example North Shields). In addition; tracks, signalling and overhead wires are also being overhauled. Longer term plans include the procurement of an entirely new fleet of trains and further extensions to the system. Proposed routes include to Newcastle's west end, to the Cobalt business park in North Tyneside, to the Metrocentre in Gateshead and to additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Several of the proposed routes would require trams as opposed to the current light rail trains.", "Genghis Khan is regarded as one of the prominent leaders in Mongolia's history. He is responsible for the emergence of the Mongols as a political and ethnic identity because there was no unified identity between the tribes that had cultural similarity. He reinforced many Mongol traditions and provided stability and unity during a time of almost endemic warfare between tribes. He is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional Mongolian script and the creation of the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), the first written Mongolian law. \"Ikh Zasag law adopted during Genghis Khan\u2019s time in Mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily,\" Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj noted. President Elbegdorj sees Genghis Khan as a leader from whom to learn for anti-corruption efforts as Genghis Khan sought equal protection under the law for all citizens regardless of status or wealth. \"Chinggis (Genghis Khan)...was a man who deeply realized that the justice begins and consolidates with the equality of law, and not with the distinctions between people. He was a man who knew that the good laws and rules lived longer than fancy palaces,\" Elbegdorj said in his speech on the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth. In summary, Mongolians see him as the fundamental figure in the founding of the Mongol Empire and therefore the basis for Mongolia as a country.", "Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not respond to Luther's letter containing the 95 Theses. He had the theses examined for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome. He needed the income from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric. As Luther later noted, \"the pope had a finger in the pie as well, because one half was to go to the construction of St Peter's Church in Rome\"", "Of particular concern with Online pharmacies is the ease with which individuals, youngsters in particular, can acquire regulated medications (e.g., Vicodin, generically known as hydrocodone) via the Internet without a prescription issued by a doctor/practitioner who has an established doctor-patient relationship. There are many instances where a practitioner issues a prescription, brokered by an Internet server, for a regulated medication to a \"patient\" s/he has never met.[citation needed] In the United States, in order for a prescription for a regulated medication to be valid, it must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a licensed practitioner acting in the course of legitimate doctor-patient relationship. The filling pharmacy has a corresponding responsibility to ensure that the prescription is valid. Often, individual state laws outline what defines a valid patient-doctor relationship.", "Under the Scotland Act 1998, regular overall elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on).

If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of an Overall Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary overall election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary overall elections are in addition to regular overall elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of a regular overall election, in which case they supplant it.

Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misinterpreted this and other passages from Luther, while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the spirit of a man \"in this life\" (homo enim in hac vita) exhausted from his daily toil (defatigus diurno labore) who at night enters his bedchamber (sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams.", "According to PolitiFact the top 400 wealthiest Americans \"have more riches than half of all Americans combined.\" According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the \"wealthiest 1 percent in the United States now own more riches than the bottom 90 percent\". Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become affluent may have had a \"significant advantage\". In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, \"over 60 percent\" of the Forbes wealthiest 400 Americans \"grew up in significant privilege\".", "The early United States expressed its opposition to Colonialism, at least in a form distinct from its own Manifest Destiny, through policies such as the Monroe Doctrine. However, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s mission to \"make the world safe for democracy\" changed all this. They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. In 1898, Americans who opposed imperialism created the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba. One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a \"racket\" by Smedley Butler, an American general. He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents\"", "Los Angeles (at 3.7 million individuals) and San Diego (at 1.3 million people), both in southern California, are the two biggest metropolises in all of California (and two of the eight biggest metropolises in the United States).

The Scotland Act 2012 expands the delegated powers. For the purposes of parliamentary supremacy, the Legislative Assembly of the United Kingdom at Westminster continues to constitute the supreme lawmaking body of Scotland. However, under the terms of the Scotland Act, Westminster agreed to transfer some of its responsibilities over Scottish internal policy to the Scottish Legislative Assembly. Such \"delegated matters\" include education, health, agriculture and justice. The Scotland Act enabled the Scottish Legislative Assembly to pass primary legislation on these issues. A degree of internal authority, and all foreign policy, remain with the UK Legislative Assembly in Westminster. The Scottish Legislative Assembly has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-modifying capability. Another of the roles of the Legislative Assembly is to hold the Scottish Government to account.", "In the immediate post-conflict years there was little money available for other than essential renovations. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of construction work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the metal gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade.", "Phagocytosis is a crucial aspect of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that ingest, or consume, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be summoned to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been ingested by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include ingestion of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.", "Despite the high rank given to Muslims, some regulations of the Yuan Emperors severely prejudiced against them, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision, as well as Kosher butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Toward the end, corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.", "This is true throughout most of the United States as well. However, alternative approaches for primary education do exist. One of these, sometimes referred to as a \"platoon\" system, involves placing a group of pupils together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject. The benefit here is that pupils learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects. Pupils still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.", "The Panthers attack, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections.

Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the season; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second season of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third season was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part narrative called Children of Earth which was set largely in London.

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term expansionism, in slightly more discerning fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. To clarify this confusion about the description of expansionism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" expansionism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonial rule\" while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, with informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid, ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.", "The exposition of Islam promoted by this funding was the rigid, traditional Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its most stringent form it preached that Muslims should not only \"always oppose\" infidels \"in every way,\" but \"hate them for their religion ... for Allah's sake,\" that democracy \"is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century,\" that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc. While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the \"gold standard\" of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.", "What intractability signifies in reality is open to discussion. Stating that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are difficult or even that most of them are. For instance, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been demonstrated not to be in P, yet procedures have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, procedures can solve the NP-complete rucksack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.", "The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".", "are prime for any natural number n.

The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taih\u014d Code (701) and re-stated in the Y\u014dr\u014d Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists\u2014and even pharmacist assistants\u2014were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.", "The appendages of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with appendages (\"little appendages\"), although a few genera have simple appendages without these sidebranches. The appendages and appendages are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own appendages \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The appendages of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the appendages of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' appendages have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the appendages to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.", "Right-wing investigators have contended that income disparity is not substantial because expenditure, rather than income should be the metric of disparity, and disparity of expenditure is less severe than disparity of income in the US. Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that \"the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption disparity has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income disparity,\" and expenditure is more important than income. According to Johnson, Smeeding, and Tory, consumption disparity was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986. The debate is summarized in \"The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor\" by journalist Thomas B. Edsall. Other studies have not found consumption disparity less dramatic than household income disparity, and the CBO's study found consumption data not \"adequately\" capturing \"consumption by high-income households\" as it does their income, though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.", "The Swahili built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states, as well as commercial centres in Persia, Arabia, and even India.

Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings.

For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.", "Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era. The mathematician Zhu Shijie (1249\u20131314) solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients, equivalent to modern matrices.

This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.", "A third type of hypotheses concerns aspects of the distribution of primes. It is hypothesized that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime conjecture). Polignac's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture, it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n. It is hypothesized there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1. These hypotheses are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n2 and (n + 1)2 for every positive integer n. It is implied by the stronger Cram\u00e9r's conjecture.", "In addition to the General Assembly Hall, the Parliament also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council. The former administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The former Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council) housed the Parliament's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the Parliament's primary committee room.", "This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver. Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).", "Railway transportation in Victoria is provided by several private and public railway operators who operate over government-owned lines. Major operators include: Metro Trains Melbourne which runs an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs; V/Line which is now owned by the Victorian Government, operates a concentrated service to major regional centres, as well as long distance services on other lines; Pacific National, CFCL Australia which operate freight services; Great Southern Rail which operates The Overland Melbourne\u2014Adelaide; and NSW TrainLink which operates XPTs Melbourne\u2014Sydney.", "The feeble force is due to the exchange of the massive W and Z bosons. Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. The word \"feeble\" derives from the fact that the field intensity is some 1013 times less than that of the robust force. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the feeble force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1013 kelvins. Such temperatures have been probed in modern particle accelerators and show the conditions of the universe in the early moments of the Big Bang.", "The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight with a live S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified the security of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.", "The concept \"power\" keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the mechanics is now described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation instead of Newtonian equations. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes \"quantized\", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of \"powers\". However, the potentials V(x,y,z) or fields, from which the powers generally can be derived, are treated similar to classical position variables, i.e., .", "Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of tiny crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. Only 100\u2013150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable appendages fringed with tentilla (\"little appendages\") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack appendages and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.", "Educators in Wales can be registered members of trade unions such as ATL, NUT or NASUWT and reports in recent years suggest that the average age of educators in Wales is falling with educators being younger than in previous years.

Heath asked the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter. The UK, Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland banned piloting, operating and sailing on Sundays. Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil. The Netherlands imposed prison sentences for those who used more than their ration of electricity.", "Starting in 1894, Tesla began exploring what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-Rays\"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Soon after, much of Tesla's early research\u2014hundreds of invention models, plans, notes, laboratory data, tools, photographs, valued at $50,000\u2014was lost in the 5th Avenue laboratory fire of March 1895. Tesla is quoted by The New York Times as saying, \"I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?\" Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image\u2014predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of x-rays\u2014when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.

The city also has a Radio Lollipop station based at the Great North Children's Hospital in the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary.", "Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where, during each stroke, the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam, whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature. The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction. By this means, the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower. However, the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties.[citation needed]. The Quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas, while exhausting in cold areas.", "Colonialism has played a significant role in the histories of Japan, Korea, the Assyrian Empire, the Chinese Empire, the Roman Empire, Greece, the Byzantine Empire, the Persian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Ancient Egypt, the British Empire, India, and many other empires. Colonialism was a fundamental component to the conquests of Genghis Khan during the Mongol Empire, and of other warlords. Historically recognized Muslim empires number in the dozens. Sub-Saharan Africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the European colonial era, for example the Ethiopian Empire, Oyo Empire, Asante Union, Luba Empire, Lunda Empire, and Mutapa Empire. The Americas during the pre-Columbian era also had large empires such as the Aztec Empire and the Incan Empire.", "In most nations, the dispensary is subject to pharmaceutical law; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in law. Where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding/dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmaceutical technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients. Pharmaceutical technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients' prescriptions and patient safety issues.", "An oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the fulcrum mounting (trunnion). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.[citation needed]", "Fresno (/\u02c8fr\u025bzno\u028a/ FREZ-noh), the county seat of Fresno County, is a metropolis in the U.S. state of California. As of 2015, the city's population was 520,159, making it the fifth-largest city in California, the largest inland city in California and the 34th-largest in the nation. Fresno is in the center of the San Joaquin Valley and is the largest city in the Central Valley, which contains the San Joaquin Valley. It is approximately 220 miles (350 km) northwest of Los Angeles, 170 miles (270 km) south of the state capital, Sacramento, or 185 miles (300 km) south of San Francisco. The designation Fresno means \"ash tree\" in Spanish, and an ash leaf is featured on the city's flag.", "Education using pedagogy also involves evaluating the educational levels of the pupils on particular skills. Understanding the pedagogy of the pupils in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all pupils in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, education itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of teaching styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when an educator assesses the pedagogic diversity of his/her pupils and differentiates for the individual pupils accordingly. For example, an experienced educator and parent described the place of an educator in learning as follows: \"The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the educator is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game.\"", "Southern California's economy is varied and one of the largest in the United States. It is dominated and highly dependent upon abundance of petroleum, as opposed to other regions where automobiles not nearly as dominant, the vast majority of transport runs on this fuel. Southern California is famous for tourism and Hollywood (film, television, and music). Other industries include software, automotive, ports, finance, tourism, biomedical, and regional logistics. The region was a leader in the housing bubble 2001\u20132007, and has been heavily impacted by the housing crash.", "Luther's Small Catechism proved especially efficient in helping guardians instruct their offspring; likewise the Larger Catechism was effective for clergy. Using the German vernacular, they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Luther's goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the occupation of the three persons of the Trinity, each of which works in the catechumen's life. That is, Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned, but as persons to be known. The Father creates, the Son redeems, and the Spirit sanctifies, a divine unity with separate personalities. Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father. Luther's treatment of the Apostles' Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) and the Lord's Prayer, which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching.", "The fundamental legislation of the EU consists mainly of the founding agreements, the \"core\" agreements being the Agreement on European Union (TEU) and the Agreement on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Agreements contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of powers between the European Union and its member states. The TEU establishes that European Union legislation applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union legislation also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the \u00c5land islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union legislation. Agreements apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the agreement was signed no longer apply.[vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives. The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Agreements, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law. Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional.", "When suffering from sleep deprivation, active immunizations may have a reduced effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.", "Luther composed \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (\"Oh God, look down from heaven\"). \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" (Now come, Savior of the gentiles), based on Veni redemptor gentium, became the principal hymn (Hauptlied) for Advent. He transformed A solus ortus cardine to \"Christum wir sollen loben schon\" (\"We should now praise Christ\") and Veni Creator Spiritus to \"Komm, Gott Sch\u00f6pfer, Heiliger Geist\" (\"Come, Holy Spirit, Lord God\"). He wrote two songs on the Ten Commandments, \"Dies sind die heilgen Zehn Gebot\" and \"Mensch, willst du leben seliglich\". His \"Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ\" (\"Praise be to You, Jesus Christ\") became the principal hymn for Christmas. He wrote for Pentecost \"Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist\", and adopted for Easter \"Christ ist erstanden\" (Christ is risen), based on Victimae paschali laudes. \"Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin\", a paraphrase of Nunc dimittis, was intended for Purification, but became also a funeral song. He paraphrased the Te Deum as \"Herr Gott, dich loben wir\" with a simplified form of the melody. It became known as the German Te Deum.", "The Decalogue, and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism, are a present foreshadowing of the believers' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life. Luther's teaching of the Decalogue, therefore, has clear eschatological overtones, which, characteristically for Luther, do not encourage world-flight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common, daily vocations of this perishing world.", "However, this definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy pitching the conscience vs. the collective. The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau\u2019s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, \"Resign.\" If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is \"the voice of the people,\" as it is often called, shouldn\u2019t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is \"liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\" Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right. What, then, is the proper relationship between the individual and the government?", "On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and set up his South Fifth Avenue laboratory, and later another at 46 E. Houston Street, in New York. He lit electric lamps wirelessly at both locations, demonstrating the potential of wireless power transmission. In the same year, he patented the Tesla coil.", "Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through dynamic calculations. However, while dynamics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.", "ABC dominated the American television landscape during the 1970s and early 1980s (by 1980, the three major networks represented 90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S.). Several flagship series debuted on the network during this time including Dynasty, an extravagant soap opera from Aaron Spelling that became a hit when it premiered as a midseason series in 1981, five months before Spelling's other ABC hit Charlie's Angels ended its run. The network was also propelled during the early 1980s by the continued successes of Happy Days, Three's Company, Laverne & Shirley and Fantasy Island, and gained new hits in Too Close for Comfort, Soap spinoff Benson and Happy Days spinoff Mork & Mindy. In 1981, ABC (through its ABC Video Services division) launched the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS), a cable channel operated as a joint venture with the Hearst Corporation offering cultural and arts programming, which aired as a nighttime service over the channel space of Nickelodeon.", "Tesla noted the perils of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.", "In 1900, Tesla was awarded licenses for a \"method of transmitting electrical power\" and \"an electrical transmitter.\" When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla joked that it was done with 17 Tesla licenses, though there is little to support this assertion. This was the beginning of years of patent disputes over radio with Tesla's licenses being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision reinstated the prior licenses of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain licenses were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same licenses (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply reinstating Tesla's prior license)", "Egyptian President Anwar Sadat \u2013 whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (infitah); transferring Egypt's allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and making peace with Israel \u2013 released Muslims from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists. His \"encouragement of the emergence of the Muslim movement\" was said to have been \"imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed.\"  This \"gentlemen's agreement\" between Sadat and Muslims broke down in 1975 but not before Muslims came to completely dominate university student unions. Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s.

Although many facilities and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe's biggest internal harbour and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes 70 m3/s (2,500 cu ft/s) to the Rhine. Other rivers in the Ruhr Area, above all, the Emscher, still carry a considerable degree of pollution.", "Following the demise of Braddock, William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America. At a conference in Albany in December 1755, he outlined his plans for 1756. In addition to renewing the efforts to capture Niagara, Crown Point and Duquesne, he proposed assaults on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudi\u00e8re River to attack the city of Quebec. Hindered by disagreements and disputes with others, including William Johnson and New York's Governor Sir Charles Hardy, Shirley's plan had little support.", "Tesla also elucidated the principles of the rotating magnetic field in an induction motor by showcasing how to make a copper egg stand on end using a device he constructed known as the Egg of Columbus.", "Protestant numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562, concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France, about one-eighth the number of French Catholics. As Protestants gained influence and more openly displayed their faith, Catholic hostility grew, in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and decrees of toleration from the French crown. A series of religious conflicts followed, known as the Conflicts of Faith, fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598. The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Protestants substantial religious, political and military autonomy.", "Despite his triumph in Wittenberg, Luther was unable to suppress extremism further afield. Clergymen such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas M\u00fcntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524\u201325, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name. There had been uprisings by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with \"liberal\" phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general. Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as M\u00fcntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.", "Generally speaking, while all member states acknowledge that EU law takes precedence over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.", "On Carolina's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line.

The network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year's debuts, with only late-season premiere Happy Endings earning a second season. Meanwhile, the new lows hit by Brothers & Sisters led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only theatrical show renewal, V, also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run. Despite this and another noticeable ratings decline, ABC would manage to outrate NBC for third place by a larger margin than the previous year.", "In 1521 Luther dealt largely with prediction, in which he broadened the foundations of the Reformation placing them on prophetic faith.

Proposals for a 'decentralized' Legislature were made before 1914, but were postponed due to the outbreak of the First World War. A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence, and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution. One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs.", "Luther's vanishing during his return trip back to Wittenberg was planned. Frederick III had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen who were made to appear as armed robbers. They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach. During his stay at Wartburg, which he referred to as \"my Patmos\", Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings. These included a renewed attack on Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz, whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates, and a \"Refutation of the Argument of Latomus,\" in which he expounded the principle of justification to Jacobus Latomus, an orthodox theologian from Louvain.", "The Apollo program succeeded in achieving its objective of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 compartment blaze that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which disabled the command spacecraft's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions.", "In the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra will broadcast the competition.

Unlike sponges, both Ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few Ctenophore species lack them.", "It has been argued that the term \"civic noncompliance\" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, \"It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official.

The following day, oil ministers agreed to the boycott, a reduction in production by five percent from September's output and to continue to reduce production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met. On October 19, Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $2.2 billion in crisis assistance to Israel, including $1.5 billion in outright grants. George Lenczowski notes, \"Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon's eagerness to prevent Israel's collapse...This [$2.2 billion] decision triggered a collective OPEC response.\" Libya immediately announced it would boycott oil shipments to the United States.

A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings, and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts. The design usually consists of drawings and specifications, usually prepared by a design team including Architect, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, structural engineers, fire protection engineers, planning consultants, architectural consultants, and archaeological consultants. The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor. Following evaluation of bids, the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.", "Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E. Fuller has characterized as the fundamentalist \"guardians of the tradition\" (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the \"vanguard of transformation and Islamic reform\" centered around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that \"Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century\" when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on \"sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,\" and rejection of Shia Islam. Following the Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamism as \"increasingly interdependent\" with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world, such that \"neither can now survive without the other.\" While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.", "Phycobilins are a third group of pigments found in cyanobacteria, and glaucophyte, red algal, and cryptophyte chloroplasts. Phycobilins come in all colors, though phycoerytherin is one of the pigments that makes many red algae red. Phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called phycobilisomes. Like photosystem I and ATP synthase, phycobilisomes jut into the stroma, preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts. Cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria don't have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and keep them in their thylakoid space instead.", "Doctor Who finally returned with the episode \"Rose\" on BBC One on 26 March 2005.

By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 \u00b0C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.[citation needed]", "The Lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four pinnae, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.", "With 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, and soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller stripped the ball away from Newton, and after several players dove for it, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Although several players dove into the pile to attempt to recover it, Newton did not and his lack of aggression later earned him heavy criticism. Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving Denver a 24\u201310 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away.

Expansionism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's supremacy, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while expansionism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between expansionism and colonialism by stating; \"expansionism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that expansionism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply expansionism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]", "Assistant T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the assistant cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. Assistant T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for cytotoxic T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200\u2013300) on the assistant T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the assistant cell, while cytotoxic T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Assistant T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting assistant T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by assistant T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of cytotoxic T cells. In addition, assistant T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.", "The First British empire was based on mercantilism, and involved settlements and possessions primarily in North America, the Caribbean, and India. Its expansion was reversed by the loss of the American settlements in 1776. Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of commerce and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies about 1820. By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free commerce that gave it dominance in the commerce of much of the world. After losing its first empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial possessions around the globe. Increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler settlements in the 20th century.", "Paul Revere was descended from Huguenot refugees, as was Henry Laurens, who signed the Articles of Confederation for South Carolina; Jack Jouett, who made the ride from Cuckoo Tavern to warn Thomas Jefferson and others that Tarleton and his men were on their way to arrest him for crimes against the king; Francis Marion, and a number of other leaders of the American Revolution and later statesmen.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.", "Southern California comprises one of the more diverse assemblies of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a variety outnumbering other major regions in the state and country.

The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature. The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.", "In 1882, Tesla commenced working for the Continental Edison Company in France, designing and making enhancements to electrical apparatus.

During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school, Higher Real Gymnasium, in Gospi\u0107.", "In 1888, the publisher of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and promoter), arranged for Tesla to exhibit his oscillating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE). Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system \u2014 something for which Westinghouse had been trying to secure patents. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor presented in a paper in March 1888 by the Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided Tesla's patent would probably control the market.", "In 1981, the Presidential Working Party on the Second University was commissioned to examine both the possibilities of establishing a second university in Kenya as well as the reforming of the entire educational system. The committee recommended that the 7\u20134\u20132\u20133 system be changed to an 8\u20134\u20134 system (eight years in primary, four years in secondary, and four years in university education). The table under Present-day education in Kenya below shows the structure of the 8\u20134\u20134 system. Although the 7\u20134\u20132\u20133 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8\u20134\u20134 system in 1985, the last cohort of students from the previous system graduated from Kenyan Universities in 1992.", "In what became known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Slaughter of 24 August \u2013 3 October 1572, Catholics slaughtered thousands of Huguenots in Paris. Similar slaughters took place in other towns in the weeks following. The main provincial towns and cities experiencing the Slaughter were Aix, Bordeaux, Bourges, Lyons, Meaux, Orleans, Rouen, Toulouse, and Troyes. Nearly 3,000 Protestants were butchered in Toulouse alone. The exact number of fatalities throughout the country is not known. On 23\u201324 August, between about 2,000 and 3,000 Protestants were killed in Paris and between 3,000 and 7,000 more in the French provinces. By 17 September, almost 25,000 Protestants had been massacred in Paris alone. Beyond Paris, the killings continued until 3 October.

Kuznets demonstrated this correlation using cross-sectional data. However, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. Kuznets' curve predicts that revenue disparity will eventually decrease given time. As an example, revenue disparity did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of revenue disparity began to rise after the 1970s. This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets' theory.[citation needed] It may be possible that another Kuznets' cycle is occurring, specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.[citation needed] This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in effect at any given time.", "Southern California's economy is diverse and one of the biggest in the United States. It is controlled and heavily reliant upon abundance of oil, as opposed to other regions where cars not nearly as prevalent, the vast majority of transportation runs on this fuel.

Trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism, and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about Islam and Islamic law. Maududi founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972. However, Maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising. His extremely influential books (translated into many languages) placed Islam in a modern context, and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer Islamists such as al-Faruqi, whose \"Islamization of Knowledge\" carried forward some of Maududi's key principles.", "In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to evade a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground. Tesla's back was severely strained and three of his ribs were fractured in the incident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor\u2014an almost lifelong custom). Tesla didn't raise any query as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking to be taken to his hotel via cab. Tesla was confined to bed for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window; soon, they failed to come. In early 1938, Tesla was able to get up. He at once resumed the pigeon-feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had a messenger act for him.", "Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as \"Constituency MSPs\". Electors choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 voters. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of voters, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.", "The chronicler Frederick W. Mote wrote that the usage of the term \"social strata\" for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social influence and affluence, but just entailed \"degrees of privilege\" to which they were entitled institutionally and legally, so a person's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing, since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese while there were less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated.", "The loftiest building in Downtown Jacksonville's skyline is the Financial Institution of America Tower, constructed in 1990 as the Barnett Center.

In On the Abrogation of the Private Mass, he denounced as idolatry the notion that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with gratitude by the whole congregation. His essay On Confession, Whether the Pope has the Authority to Require It rejected mandatory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution, since \"every Christian is a confessor.\" In November, Luther wrote The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows. He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and futile attempt to attain salvation.", "Based on his industrial expertise on Air Force missile undertakings, Mueller realized some skilled administrators could be found among high-ranking officers in the United States Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit General Samuel C.

Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the armed forces planning. He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun. He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the setbacks of 1757. Pitt's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops, supported by the provincial militias, aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France. Two of the expeditions were successful, with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable United Kingdom forces.", "During the mid-Eocene, it is believed that the drainage watershed of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin.

The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow protection by civic noncompliants to deny culpability without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political convictions in the tribunal. However, tribunal cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 unlawful occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside tribunals despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\"", "Tesla was the fourth of five offspring.

In 1972, the new regulations resulted in the company's decision to split ABC Films into two separate companies: the existing Worldvision Enterprises, which would produce and distribute programming for U.S. syndication, and ABC Circle Films as a production unit. Worldvision was sold to a consortium of ABC executives for nearly $10 million.", "The privilege to establish independent schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency. It is also not possible to abolish these privileges. This unusual protection of independent schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future. Still, they are less common than in many other countries. Overall, between 1992 and 2008 the proportion of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% (including rise from 0.5% to 6.1% in the former GDR).

The third brigade under Genghis Khan and Tolui marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarzemia from that direction.", "Giuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p \u2212 1 or a divisor of p \u2212 1. The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p \u2212 1)! + 1 is divisible by p.

Marin followed the route that C\u00e9loron had mapped out four years earlier, but where C\u00e9loron had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle (near present-day Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore. He had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek.

Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the primary legal body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public significance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general significance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest legal offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high legal office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.", "Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficacy. These stages were called expansions, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficacy was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electrical motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.", "The fundamental agreements that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU).

According to Kuznets, nations with low levels of growth have relatively equal allocations of riches. As a nation grows, it acquires more assets, which leads to the owners of this assets having more riches and revenue and introducing disparity. Eventually, through various possible reallocation mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed nations move back to lower levels of disparity.", "Kublai Khan fostered economic, technological, and artistic development. He supported the traders of the Silk Road trade network by protecting the Mongol postal system, constructing infrastructure, providing loans that financed trade caravans, and encouraging the circulation of paper banknotes (\u9214, Chao). Mongol peace, Pax Mongolica, enabled the spread of technologies, commodities, and culture between China and the West. Kublai expanded the Grand Canal from southern China to Daidu in the north. Mongol rule was cosmopolitan under Kublai Khan. He welcomed foreign visitors to his court, such as the Venetian merchant Marco Polo, who wrote the most influential European account of Yuan China. Marco Polo's travels would later inspire many others like Christopher Columbus to chart a passage to the Far East in search of its legendary wealth.", "The pandemic illness, caused by Yersinia pestis, is endemic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.

In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the pandemic originated in China. In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and pandemics led to widespread starvation, starting in 1331, with a deadly pandemic arriving soon after.

Luther made certain accommodations to the Saxon, who was a relative of the Elector, and promised to remain silent if his opponents did. The theologian Johann Eck, however, was determined to expose Luther's doctrine in a public forum. In June and July 1519, he staged a disputation with Luther's colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak. Luther's boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture, and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible. For this, Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus, referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415. From that moment, he devoted himself to Luther's defeat.", "In previous times, physical punishment (spanking or paddling or caning or strapping or birching the student in order to cause physical pain) was one of the most common forms of school discipline throughout much of the world.

Among notable RSOs are the nation's longest continuously running student film society Doc Films, organizing committee for the Institution of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, the twice-weekly student newspaper The Chicago Maroon, the alternative weekly student newspaper South Side Weekly, the nation's second oldest continuously running student improvisational theater troupe Off-Off Campus, and the institution-owned radio station WHPK.", "The defensive system is a network of many biological components and mechanisms within an organism that safeguards against illness. To function properly, a defensive system must identify a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the defensive system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate defensive system versus the adaptive defensive system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral defensive system from the neuroimmune system which shields the brain.", "In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new districts: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt. By 1700, one-fifth of the city's inhabitants were French speaking. The Berlin Huguenots preserved the French language in their church services for nearly a century. They ultimately decided to switch to German in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon in 1806-07. Many of their descendants rose to positions of prominence. Several congregations were founded, such as those of Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden.", "Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 pupils, maintaining discipline in the classroom can divert the educator from instruction, leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught. In response, educators may concentrate their focus on motivated pupils, ignoring attention-seeking and disruptive students. The result of this is that motivated pupils, facing demanding university entrance examinations, receive disproportionate resources. Given the emphasis on attainment of university places, administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.", "The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth). Its primary constituent is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia, called \"balancers\", that sense its orientation. The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long, immobile cilia. A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers. Instead its response is determined by the animal's \"mood\", in other words the overall state of the nervous system. For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it will often put some comb rows into reverse, spinning the mouth towards the prey.", "In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and cut off all connections with his family to conceal the fact that he dropped out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the Mur River. Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets. In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused. Nikola suffered a nervous breakdown at around the same time.", "Subsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman nobles, including Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9, Roger of Montgomery in Shropshire and Hugh Lupus in Cheshire. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as noble (barwn), first entered Welsh at that time.", "Another major division within Islamic extremism is between what Graham E. Fuller has described as the orthodox \"guardians of the tradition\" (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the \"vanguard of change and Islamic reform\" centered around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that \"Sunni pan-Islamic extremism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century\" when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on \"sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,\" and rejection of Shia Islam. Following the Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamic extremism as \"increasingly interdependent\" with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world, such that \"neither can now survive without the other.\" While Islamic extremist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamic extremists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamic extremist groups.", "The United Methodist Church is the biggest sect within the broader Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million followers across the globe. In the United States, the UMC ranks as the biggest mainline Protestant sect, the biggest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third biggest Christian sect. As of 2014, worldwide membership was about 12 million: 7.2 million in the United States, and 4.4 million in Africa, Asia and Europe. It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 3.6% of the U.S population, or 9 million adult followers, self-identify with the United Methodist Church revealing a much larger number of followers than registered membership.", "Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic. The President is both the leader of state and leader of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive authority is exercised by the administration. Legislative authority is vested in both the administration and the National Assembly and the Senate. The Judiciary is independent of the administration and the legislature. There was growing concern especially during former president Daniel arap Moi's tenure that the administration was increasingly interfering with the affairs of the judiciary.[citation needed]", "Korean economist Hoesung Lee is the chairman of the IPCC since October 8, 2015, following the appointment of the new IPCC Bureau.

T cells identify a \"non-self\" target, such as a pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a \"self\" receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the cytotoxic T cell and the helper T cell. In addition there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response. Cytotoxic T cells only identify antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only identify antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.", "To remedy the causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.", "Somewhere around a billion years ago, a free-living cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell, either as nourishment or as an internal parasite, but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in. The two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that encircle all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium's gram negative cell wall, and not the phagosomal membrane from the host, which was probably lost. The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing nourishment for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium).", "Disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.", "Independent schools in Australia may be preferred for many reasons: reputation and the social standing of the 'old school tie'; better quality physical infrastructure and more amenities (e.g. playing fields, swimming pools, etc.), higher-paid educators; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education. Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools. Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer. Independent schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.[citation needed]", "Plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the stroma, but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network. In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly, attached directly to their parent thylakoid. In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a thylakoid.", "Since pressures are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing pressures. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of pressures is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that lab measurements of pressures are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of pressure offered by Newtonian mechanics.", "Tesla's exhibition of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent acquisition of the patent, both in 1888, put Tesla firmly on the \"AC\" side of the so-called \"War of Currents,\" an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888. This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for direct current and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.", "The mass of heaters and coolers generally makes the power-to-mass ratio of a vapor plant lower than for inner burning machines. For portable applications vapor has been largely replaced by inner burning machines or electric motors. However, most electric power is generated using vapor turbine plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on vapor power. Recent worries about fuel sources and contamination have sparked a renewed interest in vapor both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover. This is becoming known as the Advanced Vapor movement.[citation needed]", "Natural killer cells, or natural killer cells, are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly assault invading microorganisms. Rather, natural killer cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as \"missing self.\" This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex) \u2013 a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells. They were named \"natural killer\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are \"missing self.\" For many years it was unclear how natural killer cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells. It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the natural killer cells become activated through recognition of \"missing self\". Normal bodily cells are not recognized and attacked by natural killer cells because they express intact self MHC antibodies. Those MHC antibodies are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors (KIR) which essentially put the brakes on natural killer cells.", "Starting in 1965, Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory, UK, independently created the same message routing methodology as developed by Baran.

Intricacy measures are very generally defined by the Blum intricacy axioms. Other intricacy measures used in intricacy theory include communication intricacy, circuit intricacy, and decision tree intricacy.", "Immunology is strongly empirical in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical approach. Many hypotheses have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells \u2013 more precisely, phagocytes \u2013 that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism\u2019s \"humors\" rather than its cells.", "The movement which would become The United Methodist Church began in the mid-18th century within the Church of England. A small group of pupils, including John Wesley, Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, met on the Oxford University campus. They focused on Bible study, methodical study of scripture and living a holy life. Other pupils mocked them, saying they were the \"Holy Club\" and \"the Methodists\", being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. Eventually, the so-called Methodists started individual societies or classes for members of the Church of England who wanted to live a more religious life.", "The notion of inertia can be further broadened to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion, even those that are not strictly constant velocity. The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame. This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity.", "The concept of faunal succession is based on the emergence of remnants in sedimentary stones. As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found. Based on concepts laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the concepts of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The concept becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all remnants may be found globally at the same time.", "Teutonic clans traversed the Rhine in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine.

Li Tan, the son-in-law of a powerful official, instigated a revolt against Mongol rule in 1262. After successfully suppressing the revolt, Kublai curbed the influence of the Han Chinese advisers in his court. He feared that his dependence on Chinese officials left him vulnerable to future revolts and defections to the Song.", "A cylindrical Service Module (SM) supported the Command Module, with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants, and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants. A high-gain S-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights. On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. The Service Module was discarded just before re-entry. The module was 24.6 feet (7.5 m) long and 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter.

It took French troops years to hunt down and destroy all the bands of Camisards, between 1702 and 1709.", "In accordance with his father's wishes, Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately, believing that law represented uncertainty. Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy, expressing particular interest in Aristotle, William of Ockham, and Gabriel Biel. He was deeply influenced by two tutors, Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter, who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience. Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying, offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly important to him.", "As a consequence, plastids in C4 mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, plastids are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack rubisco, and have normal grana and thylakoids, which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store CO2 in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath plastids, where it drops off CO2 and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath plastids do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity. Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks\u2014though bundle sheath plastids still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow, a light-driven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack photosystem II, and only have photosystem I\u2014the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow. Because the job of bundle sheath plastids is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large starch grains.", "Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are cultivated in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. Coconuts, pineapples, cashew nuts, cotton, sugarcane, sisal, and corn are cultivated in the lower-lying areas. Unfortunately, the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid. Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets. This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross.", "In addition to chlorophylls, another group of yellow\u2013orange pigments called carotenoids are also found in the photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the fall, when the leaves of some land plants change color. \u03b2-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.", "The basic theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains. An example of such a domain is the Gaussian integers Z[i], that is, the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as Gaussian primes. Not every prime (in Z) is a Gaussian prime: in the bigger ring Z[i], 2 factors into the product of the two Gaussian primes (1 + i) and (1 \u2212 i).

The new emblem premiered on-air for ABC's advertisements at the start of the 1963\u201364 season. The letters are strongly evocative of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The emblem's simplicity made it easier to revamp and replicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics).", "The discussions were successfully concluded on 17 February 1546. After 8 a.m., he experienced thoracic pains.

When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant measures until Loudoun approved them. Montcalm took bold action against his inaction. Building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison, Montcalm executed a tactical maneuver by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Indians.", "The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants.

Kublai convened a kurultai in Kaiping that elected him Supreme Khan. A rival kurultai in Mongolia proclaimed Ariq B\u00f6ke Supreme Khan, beginning a civil conflict. Kublai depended on the cooperation of his Chinese subjects to ensure that his army received ample resources. He bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional Chinese empires and adopting the Chinese era name of Zhongtong. Ariq B\u00f6ke was hampered by inadequate supplies and surrendered in 1264. All of the three western khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate) became functionally autonomous, although only the Ilkhans truly recognized Kublai as Supreme Khan. Civil strife had permanently divided the Mongolian Empire.", "This forecast was not included in the final overview for policymakers. The IPCC has since acknowledged that the date is incorrect, while reaffirming that the conclusion in the final overview was robust. They expressed regret for \"the poor application of well-established IPCC procedures in this instance\". The date of 2035 has been correctly quoted by the IPCC from the WWF report, which has misquoted its own source, an ICSI report \"Variations of Snow and Ice in the past and at present on a Global and Regional Scale\".", "In 1755, six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock, the newly arrived British Army commander, and planned a four-way attack on the French. None succeeded and the main effort by Braddock was a disaster; he was defeated in the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9, 1755 and died a few days later. British operations in 1755, 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York all failed, due to a combination of poor management, internal divisions, and effective Canadian scouts, French regular forces, and Indian warrior allies. In 1755, the British captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians. Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley, Commander-in-Chief, North America, without direction from Great Britain. The Acadians, both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty, were expelled. Native Americans were likewise driven off their land to make way for settlers from New England.", "During the English Civil War, the Northern declared for the King. In a bid to gain Newcastle and the Tyne, Cromwell's allies, the Scots, captured the town of Newburn. In 1644 the Scots then captured the reinforced fortification on the Lawe in South Shields following a siege. In 1644 the city was then besieged for many months and was eventually stormed ('with roaring drummes') and sacked by Cromwell's allies. The grateful King bestowed the motto \"Fortiter Defendit Triumphans\" (\"Triumphing by a brave defence\") upon the town. Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646\u20137.", "With the demise of Captain Francis Fowke, Royal Engineers the next architect to work at the museum was Colonel (later Major General) Henry Young Darracott Scott, also of the Royal Engineers. He designed to the north west of the garden the five-storey School for Naval Architects (also known as the science schools), now the Henry Cole Wing in 1867\u201372. Scott's assistant J.W. Wild designed the impressive staircase that rises the full height of the building, made from Cadeby stone the steps are 7 feet (2.1 m) in length, the balustrades and columns are Portland stone.

However, simulations of Amazon basin climate shift across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any precipitation response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. The result indicates that the jungle could be threatened though the 21st century by climate shift in addition to deforestation.", "Photoreduction can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high. Rubisco cannot differentiate between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis\u2014it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO2, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms, or CCMs. These include Crassulacean acid metabolism, C4 carbon fixation, and pyrenoids. Chloroplasts in C4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.", "With a budget of $230,000, the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy. The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.", "It is acknowledged that a statistical report of the epidemic is equally significant as a recognition of indications, but researchers are hindered by the lack of trustworthy data from this era. Most work has been done on the dissemination of the epidemic in England, and even approximations of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377. Approximations of epidemic casualties are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.", "In addition to the General Assembly Hall, the Legislature also used buildings rented from the City of Edinburgh Council. The previous administrative building of Lothian Regional Council on George IV Bridge was used for the MSP's offices. Following the move to Holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished. The previous Midlothian County Buildings facing Parliament Square, High Street and George IV Bridge in Edinburgh (originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 Midlothian County Council) housed the Legislature's visitors' centre and shop, whilst the main hall was used as the Legislature's principal committee room.", "He produced artificial lightning, with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long. Clap from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in Cripple Creek, Colorado. People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Sparks sprang from water line taps when touched. Light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of St. Elmo's fire around their wings.", "On June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the practice of branding Super Bowl games with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V, would be temporarily suspended, and that the game would be named using Arabic numerals as Super Bowl 50 as opposed to Super Bowl L. The use of Roman numerals will be reinstated for Super Bowl LI. Jaime Weston, the league's vice president of brand and creative, explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty of designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter \"L\" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. The logo also deviates from the template by featuring large numerals, colored in gold, behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.", "On 1 July 1851, orders were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute autonomy of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria. Days later, still in 1851 gold was found near Ballarat, and subsequently at Bendigo. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. This triggered one of the largest gold rushes the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both inhabitants and economic power. In ten years the inhabitants of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced including the \"richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world\" and the largest gold nugget. Victoria produced in the decade 1851\u20131860 20 million ounces of gold, one third of the world's output[citation needed].", "Learning in Wales differs in certain respects from learning elsewhere in the United Kingdom. For example, a significant number of students all over Wales are educated either wholly or largely through the medium of Welsh: in 2008/09, 22 per cent of classes in maintained primary schools used Welsh as the sole or main medium of instruction. Bilingual education is available to all age groups through nurseries, schools, colleges and universities and in adult education; lessons in the language itself are compulsory for all pupils until the age of 16.", "The mouth of the Rhine into Lake Constance forms an inland delta. The delta is delimited in the West by the Former Rhine and in the East by a modern canalized section. Most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary. It includes the Austrian towns of Gai\u00dfau, H\u00f6chst and Fu\u00dfach. The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments. In the local Alemannic dialect, the singular is pronounced \"Isel\" and this is also the local pronunciation of Donkey (\"Esel\"). Many local fields have an official name containing this element.", "Although it is generally accepted that EU law has supremacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have \"direct effect\". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States\u2019. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.", "East and Central Africa's largest economy has posted tremendous growth in the service sector, boosted by rapid expansion in telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade, and now contributes 62% of GDP. 22% of GDP still comes from the unstable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the workforce (a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food security \u2013 an important catalyst of economic growth) A small portion of the population relies on food aid. Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP.

They also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better comprehend the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area. In addition, they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings.", "Since the 2005 reboot, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female associate, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the associate as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each associate and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary associates of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary associate figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs. The tenth series will introduce Pearl Mackie as Bill, the Doctor's newest traveling associate.", "The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of fractures and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Fractures are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fracture is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fracture, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fracture is a normal fracture or a thrust fracture.", "Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from only a small number (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.", "Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time \u2013 defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved trajectory. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"gravitational force\".", "This transformation has already begun in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive compensation from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"senior care pharmacy.\"", "Luther is revered on 18 February with a memorial in the Lutheran Calendar of Saints and in the Episcopal (United States) Calendar of Saints.

Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler. Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives.", "The show's first episode, An Unearthly Child, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman.

The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"The Empty Child\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"Smith and Jones\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"Fear Her\" (2006) and \"The Doctor's Daughter\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.", "Luther declined to recant his writings. He is sometimes also quoted as saying: \"Here I stand. I can do no other\". Recent scholars consider the evidence for these words to be unreliable, since they were inserted before \"May God help me\" only in later versions of the speech and not recorded in witness accounts of the proceedings. However, Mullett suggests that given his nature, \"we are free to believe that Luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words.\"", "Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Subordinate sources include regulations and directives which are based on the Treaties. The legislature of the European Union is principally composed of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, which under the Treaties may establish subordinate law to pursue the objective set out in the Treaties.", "The framework of administrative system created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire, including that of the Han Chinese, Khitans, Jurchens, Mongols, and Tibetan Buddhists. While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties, the Yuan administrative system actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures. The Chinese-style elements of the administrative system mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This administration adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: \u6a1e\u5bc6\u9662) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local administration institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian administrative system, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central administration institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of K\u00fcl\u00fcg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.", "Subordinate to the General Conference are the jurisdictional and key conferences which also meet every four years.

Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment and optimization.", "In many nations, there is a Gender salary disparity in favor of males in the job market. Several factors other than bias may contribute to this disparity. On average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than compensation when looking for employment, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. Thomas Sowell, in his book Knowledge and Decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. A U.S. Census's report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. The salary disparity in other countries ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain.", "Their local adversaries, Polonia Warsaw, have substantially fewer fans, yet they managed to claim Ekstraklasa Championship in 2000.

He tried to put these ideas to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project. In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.", "Following a plebiscite in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate voted for devolution, the current Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature. The Act delineates the legislative authority of the Parliament \u2013 the domains in which it can make laws \u2013 by explicitly specifying powers that are \"reserved\" to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster.

Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell connections and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.", "Following the election of the UK Labour Party to administration in 1997, the UK formally subscribed to the Accord on Societal Policy, which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the Societal Chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam. The UK subsequently adopted the main legislation previously agreed under the Accord on Societal Policy, the 1994 Works Council Directive, which required workforce consultation in businesses, and the 1996 Parental Leave Directive. In the 10 years following the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam and adoption of the Societal Chapter the European Union has undertaken policy initiatives in various societal policy areas, including labor and industry relations, equal opportunity, health and safety, public health, protection of children, the disabled and elderly, poverty, migrant workers, education, training and youth.", "Private educational institutions generally prefer to be called independent educational institutions, because of their autonomy to operate outside of government and local government control. Some of these are also known as public educational institutions. Preparatory schools in the UK prepare pupils aged up to 13 years old to enter public educational institutions. The name \"public educational institution\" is based on the fact that the educational institutions were open to pupils from anywhere, and not merely to those from a certain locality, and of any religion or occupation. According to The Good Educational Institutions Guide approximately 9 per cent of children being educated in the UK are doing so at fee-paying educational institutions at GSCE level and 13 per cent at A-level.[citation needed] Many independent educational institutions are single-sex (though this is becoming less common).

This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: \"It is enough for us to know that spirits do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace.\" He also rejected the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian spirits undergoing penitential suffering after demise. He affirmed the continuity of one's personal identity beyond demise. In his Smalcald Articles, he described the saints as currently residing \"in their graves and in heaven.\"", "In the immediate post-conflict years there was little funds available for other than essential renovations. The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of construction work; the first major work was the creation of new storage space for volumes in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967. This involved flooring over Aston Webb's main hall to form the book stacks, with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor (now the shop, opened in 2006). Then the lower ground-floor galleries in the south-west part of the museum were redesigned, opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600\u20131800 (late Renaissance, Baroque through Rococo and neo-Classical). In 1974 the museum had obtained what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science. In order to adapt the building as galleries, all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling. To link this to the rest of the museum, a new entrance building was constructed on the site of the former boiler house, the intended site of the Spiral, between 1978 and 1982. This building is of concrete and very functional, the only embellishment being the iron gates by Christopher Hay and Douglas Coyne of the Royal College of Art. These are set in the columned screen wall designed by Aston Webb that forms the fa\u00e7ade.", "Terra preta (dark soil), which is dispersed across vast regions in the Amazon woodland, is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous land management. The development of this fertile soil allowed farming and forestry in the previously inhospitable environment; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. In the region of the Xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon woodland were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida. Among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.", "One of its earliest massive executions was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution.

Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.", "The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the world's first railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives.", "Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where \"R\" is an organic group): hydroxides (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (R-C(O)-NR2). There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone ((CH3)2CO) and phenol (C6H5OH) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.", "In September 1958, Bank of America introduced a new commodity called BankAmericard in Fresno. After a tumultuous inception during which its founder resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first prosperous debit card; that is, a monetary tool that was usable across a large number of vendors and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier monetary products could do one or the other but not both). In 1976, BankAmericard was renamed and spun off into a separate company known today as Visa Inc.", "Computational complexity theory is a discipline of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on categorizing computational problems according to their inherent complexity, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.", "The first full-scale working rail steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the globe's first rail journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales.

Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not operational, so he worked as a designer in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became operational and Tesla was allocated the chief electrical engineer position. During his employment, Tesla made many enhancements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.", "According to the UK Government's returned 2001 census information, the city of Newcastle had a population of 189,863, whereas the metropolitan borough of Newcastle had a population of around 259,000.

He noted that atmosphere rushed in when he opened the vessel, which indicated that part of the trapped atmosphere had been utilized. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the atmosphere that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that atmosphere is a mixture of two gases; 'vital atmosphere', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. \u1f04\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \"lifeless\"), which did not support either.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living kinds. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil kinds first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern kinds \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.", "Where CHP is not used, steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of supplementary water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]", "A rich cultural multiplicity evolved during the Yuan dynasty. The major cultural accomplishments were the evolution of drama and the novel and the increased use of the written vernacular. The political unity of China and much of central Asia promoted trade between East and West. The Mongols' extensive West Asian and European contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange. The other cultures and peoples in the Mongol World Empire also very much influenced China. It had significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia until its decline; the communications between Yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in Persia, the Ilkhanate, encouraged this development. Buddhism had a great influence in the Yuan government, and the Tibetan-rite Tantric Buddhism had significantly influenced China during this period. The Muslims of the Yuan dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet in East Asia. Eastern crops such as carrots, turnips, new varieties of lemons, eggplants, and melons, high-quality granulated sugar, and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the Yuan dynasty.", "Tesla went on to pursue his concepts of cordless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs, and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of cordless communication with his devices. He tried to put these concepts to practical use in an ill-fated attempt at intercontinental cordless transmission, his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project. In his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a cordless controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited.", "Today, the Treaty of Lisbon forbids anti-competitive accords in Article 101(1), including price fixing. According to Article 101(2) any such accords are automatically void.

Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position, such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing. Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers between firms (the current regulation is the Regulation 139/2004/EC). The general test is whether a concentration (i.e. merger or acquisition) with a community dimension (i.e. affects a number of EU member states) might significantly impede effective competition. Articles 106 and 107 provide that member state's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed, but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies.

The result is the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.[citation needed]", "Later in life, Tesla made claims concerning a \"teleforce\" weapon after studying the Van de Graaff generator.

When he arrived in Albany, Abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them. Montcalm took bold action against his inertia. Building on Vaudreuil's work harassing the Oswego garrison, Montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga, as if to presage another attack along Lake George. With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany, Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August. In the aftermath, Montcalm and the Native Americans under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners' personal effects. The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Native Americans from stripping the prisoners of their valuables, which angered the Native Americans.", "Financing for private educational institutions is generally provided through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/voucher funds, and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals. Government financing for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly prohibited, according to the courts' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments. Non-religious private educational institutions theoretically could qualify for such financing without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public financing they could get with charter status.", "When the Committee for Peaceful Action sponsored a demonstration in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the demonstrators attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced apprehension. At a pre-arranged announced time, one at a time they stepped across the \"line\" and were immediately apprehended. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A well known civil rights lawyer, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the arrested persons, advising them to plead \"nolo contendere\", as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty. The arrested persons were found \"guilty,\" nevertheless, and given suspended sentences, conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.[citation needed]", "Howard Zinn writes, \"There may be many times when demonstrators choose to go to prison, as a way of continuing their demonstration, as a way of reminding their countrymen of unfairness. But that is different than the notion that they must go to prison as part of a rule connected with nonviolent resistance. The key point is that the spirit of demonstration should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in prison, or by evading it. To accept prison penitently as an accession to 'the rules' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the demonstration...In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\"", "Often regulations apply to all merchandise neutrally, but may have a greater practical impact on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.", "Sudbury model democratic schools claim that widely based power can maintain order more effectively than authoritarian power for governments and schools alike. They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else. Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole, thence the school ambiance is one of persuasion and negotiation, rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront. Sudbury model democratic schools' proponents argue that a school that has good, clear laws, fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community, and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws, is a school in which community discipline prevails, and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops, against other schools today, where rules are arbitrary, power is absolute, punishment is capricious, and due process of law is unknown.", "The incursions of Baghdad, Samarkand, Urgench, Kiev, Vladimir among others caused mass homicides, such as when portions of southern Khuzestan were completely devastated.

P. Morgan, involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. Although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare. To secure further loans, Westinghouse was forced to revisit Tesla's AC patent, which bankers considered a financial strain on the company (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck). In 1897, Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.", "The Shah's military was split by diverse internal strife and by the Shah's decision to divide his military into small units concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol military quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics.

Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually \"shortening the cutoff\" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (\"kick back\").[citation needed]", "On 23 June 2005, Rep.

Pharmaceutical informaticists work in many practice domains of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies. As a practice domain and specialist field, pharmaceutical informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals. Pharmacists in this domain are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment and optimization.", "Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O 2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O 2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.", "Preservation is responsible for the long-term protection of the collections, and covers all the collections held by the V&A and the V&A Museum of Childhood. The restorers specialise in particular areas of preservation. Areas covered by restorer's work include \"preventive\" preservation this includes: performing surveys, assessments and providing advice on the handling of items, correct packaging, mounting and handling procedures during movement and display to reduce risk of damaging objects. Activities include controlling the gallery environment (for example, temperature and light) and preventing pests (primarily insects) from damaging artefacts. The other major category is \"interventive\" preservation, this includes: cleaning and reintegration to strengthen fragile objects, reveal original surface decoration, and restore shape. Interventive treatment makes an object more stable, but also more attractive and comprehensible to the viewer. It is usually undertaken on items that are to go on public display.", "Following the subjugation of Dali in 1253, the former ruling Duan dynasty were appointed as governors-general, recognized as imperial officials by the Yuan, Ming, and Qing-era administrations, principally in the province of Yunnan. Succession for the Yuan dynasty, however, was an intractable problem, later causing much strife and internal struggle. This emerged as early as the end of Kublai's reign. Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285. Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother K\u00f6kejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Tem\u00fcr Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307. Tem\u00fcr Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather. He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades. However, the corruption in the Yuan dynasty began during the reign of Tem\u00fcr Khan.", "The \"West Side\" of Fresno, also often called \"Southwest Fresno\", is one of the oldest districts in the city.

From 1531 to 1546, his health deteriorated further. The years of struggle with Rome, the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers, and the controversy which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident, in which Luther had played a leading role, all may have contributed. In 1536, he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones, and arthritis, and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum. In December 1544, he began to feel the effects of angina.", "Other retail destinations in Newcastle include Grainger Street and the area around Grey's Monument, the relatively modern Eldon Garden and Monument Mall complexes, the Newgate Centre, Central Arcade and the traditional Grainger Market.

Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension. Rapid heating and changes of flora, to open woodland, began about 13,000 BP. By 9000 BP, Europe was fully wooded. With globally shrinking ice-cover, ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated. Meltwater, adding to the ocean and land subsidence, drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally.", "In the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, inspired by a proposal made by Niels Jerne, conceived the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity. On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a hypothesis of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: \"self\" components (components of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while \"nonself\" entities (pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response. The hypothesis was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex \"two-signal\" activation of T cells. The self/nonself hypothesis of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.", "Kublai's administration after 1262 was a compromise between preserving Mongol interests in China and satisfying the demands of his Chinese subjects. He instituted the reforms proposed by his Chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy, expanding the circulation of paper money, and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron. He restored the Imperial Secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past Chinese dynasties unchanged. However, Kublai rejected plans to revive the Confucian imperial examinations and divided Yuan society into three, later four, classes with the Han Chinese occupying the lowest rank. Kublai's Chinese advisers still wielded significant power in the government, but their official rank was nebulous.", "Royal assent: After the bill has been passed, the Presiding Officer submits it to the Monarch for royal assent and it becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament.

From 66\u201334 Mya, the jungle extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the jungle spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the jungle still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.", "ABC also owns the Times Square Studios at 1500 Broadway on land in Times Square owned by a development fund for the 42nd Street Project; opened in 1999, Good Morning America and Nightline are broadcast from this particular facility.

While en route, Washington learned of Trent's retreat. Since Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with the Mingo leader. Discovering a French reconnaissance party in the area, Washington, with Tanaghrisson and his party, ambushed the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. The historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.", "On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and established his South Fifth Avenue facility, and later another at 46 E.

Some remote sensing researchers have proposed using the measurement of the irradiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.", "Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season.

Genghis Khan recalled Subutai and Jebe back to Mongolia soon afterwards, and Jebe died on the road back to Samarkand. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unmatched to this day, and word of the Mongol victories began to trickle to other nations, particularly Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia.

At the same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view that U.S.-style job-market adaptability dramatically improves job-market outcomes.

The Panthers line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a 5-time pro bowler who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had 5 sacks in just 9 starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled 5\u00bd sacks, four forced fumbles, and four picks, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career high seven picks, while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four picks, two of which were returned for touchdowns.", "Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit. Apollo 8 was the first manned spaceship to circle another heavenly object, while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's current human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.", "Physician Who has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in Physician Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday. In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Physician at different times during the run of a play titled Doctor Who \u2013 The Ultimate Adventure. For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Physician. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Physician, while Terry Nation wrote The Curse of the Daleks, a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Physician.", "The Victoria and Albert Museum (often abbreviated as the V&A), London, is the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, housing a lasting collection of over 4.5 million objects. It was established in 1852 and named after Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The V&A is situated in the Brompton district of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area that has become known as \"Albertopolis\" because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Royal Albert Hall. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like other national British museums, entrance to the museum has been free since 2001.", "Charles W. Eliot, president 1869\u20131909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson, these beliefs were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person.", "He came to authority by uniting many of the roaming clans of Northeast Asia. After establishing the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed \"Genghis Khan\", he started the Mongol incursions that resulted in the subjugation of most of Eurasia. These included forays or invasions of the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale slaughters of the civilian populations \u2013 especially in the Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands. By the end of his life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.", "One of the earliest surviving examples of European patchwork, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection. The collection has numerous examples of various types of fabrics designed by William Morris, including, needlework, woven materials, tapestries (Including 'The Forest' tapestry of 1887), mats and floor coverings, as well as pattern books and paper designs. The art deco period is covered by mats and materials designed by Marion Dorn. From the same period there is a mat designed by Serge Chermayeff.", "Every May since 1987, the Institution of Chicago has held the Institution of Chicago Treasure Hunt, in which large groups of pupils compete to obtain notoriously obscure objects from a list.

Elway stated, \"We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms.\" The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34\u201319. In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but they are 0-4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the appointed host team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21\u201310 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.", "In one trial, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall gain in mass when tin and oxygen were heated in a sealed vessel. He noted that oxygen rushed in when he opened the vessel, which indicated that part of the trapped oxygen had been utilized. He also noted that the tin had increased in mass and that gain was the same as the mass of the oxygen that rushed back in. This and other trials on burning were documented in his book Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, which was published in 1777. In that research, he proved that oxygen is a mixture of two gases; 'vital oxygen', which is essential to burning and respiration, and azote (Gk. \u1f04\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \"lifeless\"), which did not support either.

Murphy, chief executive officer of Capital Cities Communications, contacted Leonard Goldenson about a proposal to merge their respective companies. On March 16, 1985, ABC's executive committee accepted the merger offer, which was formally announced on March 18, 1985, with Capital Cities purchasing ABC and its related properties for $3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share. To finance the purchase, Capital Cities borrowed $2.1 billion from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cites could not acquire or retain due to FCC possession rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One). The remaining $500 million was loaned by Warren Buffett, who promised that his company Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece. Due to an FCC ban on same-market possession of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new possession regulations implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E.

Comprehending the pedagogy of the pupils in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all pupils in the classroom. Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners. First, instruction itself can be taught in many different ways, hence, using a pedagogy of instruction styles. Second, the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when an instructor evaluates the pedagogic diversity of his/her pupils and differentiates for the individual pupils accordingly. For example, an experienced instructor and parent described the place of an instructor in learning as follows: \"The real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop. The function of the instructor is to pressure the lazy, inspire the bored, deflate the cocky, encourage the timid, detect and correct individual flaws, and broaden the viewpoint of all. This function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game.\"", "The Daily Mail newspaper reported in 2012 that the UK government's advantages organization was checking claimants' \"Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of advantages as a single parent is wrongly claiming to be living alone\" \u2013 as, it claimed, subscription to athletic channels would betray a man's presence in the household.

It was taken through Communist-held territory in Yan'an some 900 km on carts to safety at a Buddhist monastery, the Dongshan Dafo Dian, where it remained for ten years. In 1949, as Communist forces advanced, the Nationalist fighters moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous Tibetan monastery of Kumbum Monastery or Ta'er Shi near Xining, which soon fell under Communist control. In early 1954, Genghis Khan's coffin and relics were returned to the Master's Compound in Mongolia. By 1956 a new temple was erected there to house them. In 1968 during the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards destroyed almost everything of value. The \"relics\" were remade in the 1970s and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989.", "Studies demonstrate that pupil motivation and attitudes towards education are closely linked to pupil-educator relationships. Enthusiastic educators are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their pupils. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster pupil achievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their pupils. Useful educator-to-pupil interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement. Here, personal success is a pupil's internal goal of improving himself, whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior. An educator must guide his pupil in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals. Pupils who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these educator interactions.", "In 1564 a group of Norman Protestants under the leadership of Jean Ribault established the small colony of Fort Caroline on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is today Jacksonville, Florida. The effort was the first at any permanent European settlement in the present-day continental United States, but survived only a short time. A September 1565 French naval attack against the new Spanish colony at St. Augustine failed when its ships were hit by a hurricane on their way to the Spanish encampment at Fort Matanzas. Hundreds of French soldiers were stranded and surrendered to the numerically inferior Spanish forces led by Pedro Menendez. Menendez proceeded to massacre the defenseless Protestants, after which he wiped out the Fort Caroline garrison.", "In the 1890s, the Institution of Chicago, apprehensive that its vast resources would harm smaller institutions by drawing away talented pupils, partnered with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the institution partnered with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under the terms of the partnership, the institutions were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the institution, to notify the institution early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the institution's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The Institution of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from a partnered school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the Institution of Chicago. A student or faculty member of a partnered school was entitled to free tuition at the Institution of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend a partnered school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The Institution of Chicago also agreed to provide partnered schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the Institution of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the partnership on proper notice. Several Institution of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the institution. The program passed into history by 1910.", "The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at 1 m\u00b7s\u22122 when subjected to a force of 1 kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque.

Greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae, which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net (e.g., Oedogonium), a cup (e.g., Chlamydomonas), a ribbon-like spiral around the edges of the cell (e.g., Spirogyra), or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges (e.g., Sirogonium). Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell; they are star-shaped in Zygnema, or may follow the shape of half the cell in order Desmidiales. In some algae, the chloroplast takes up most of the cell, with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles (for example some species of Chlorella have a cup-shaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell).", "The Normans (Norman: Nourmands; French: Normands; Latin: Normanni) were the populace who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy, a territory in France. They were descended from Norse (\"Norman\" comes from \"Norseman\") raiders and pirates from Denmark, Iceland and Norway who, under their leader Rollo, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia. Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations, their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia. The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century, and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries.", "The conquests of Baghdad, Samarkand, Urgench, Kiev, Vladimir among others caused carnage, such as when portions of southern Khuzestan were completely devastated.

Over the course of three years, the Mongols destroyed and annihilated all of the major cities of Eastern Europe with the exceptions of Novgorod and Pskov.", "Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into prevalent use. Compound engines exhausted vapor in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved effectiveness. These stages were called enlargements, with double and triple expansion engines being common, especially in navigation where effectiveness was important to reduce the weight of fuel carried. Vapor motors remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion motors gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) vapor motors, with navigation in the 20th-century relying upon the vapor turbine.", "At present, the tributaries Waal and Nederrijn-Lek release to the North Sea, through the former Meuse estuary, near Rotterdam.

High levels of disparity prevent not just economic prosperity, but also the quality of a nation's institutions and high levels of education. According to IMF staff economists, \"if the revenue share of the top 20 percent (the rich) rises, then economic expansion actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the revenue share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher economic expansion. The poor and the middle class matter the most for expansion via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.\"", "CBS set the base rate for a 30-second commercial at $5,000,000, a record high price for a Super Bowl ad.

CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple commercials during the game at a steep discount. It was also the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos commercials for a chance to have it aired during the game.

This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute ages could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.", "Denver took the opening kickoff and started out strong with Peyton Manning completing an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to receiver Andre Caldwell.

The concession required that it establish 100 families in the territory, and construct a fortress for their defense. But, as the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania, both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims. In 1750 Christopher Gist, acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company, explored the Ohio territory and opened negotiations with the Native American tribes at Logstown. He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Native Americans, through their \"Half-King\" Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative, agreed to terms that included permission to build a \"strong house\" at the mouth of the Monongahela River (the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).

The pact aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing supremacy in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its supremacy had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the pact banned monopolies and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by corporations. This was the first time that competition legislation principles were included in a plurilateral regional pact and established the trans-European model of competition legislation. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition legislation as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition legislation on corporations were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive pacts, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition legislation for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid.

When Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction, Chief Hendrick said that the \"Covenant Chain\", a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown, was broken.", "A crucial element in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to learning. Learning, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this learning, however, increases in learning first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford a learning, or choose not to pursue optional learning, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of learning leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, learning raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.", "A few years after the First Crusade, in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied Petrela, the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river Deabolis, Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the Arbanon passes and opened their way to Dibra.

The core is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Legislature must vote by a majority to veto or propose modifications, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve modifications, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Legislature and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, laws can be vetoed by a majority in Legislature, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The broadcast was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational broadcast using time travel as a means to explore scientific concepts and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the broadcast was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice \u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial \u2013 The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.", "Southern California contains a Mediterranean climate, with scarce precipitation and many sunny days. Summers are sweltering and arid, while winters are a bit warm or mild and wet. Serious precipitation can occur unusually. In the summers, thermal ranges are 90-60's while as winters are 70-50's, usually all of Southern California have Mediterranean climate. But snow is very rare in the Southwest of the state, it occurs on the Southeast of the state.", "Cost controls exacerbated the emergency in the US. The system limited the cost of \"old oil\" (that which had already been discovered) while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher cost to encourage investment. Predictably, old oil was withdrawn from the market, creating greater dearth. The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies. The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration. Dearth was addressed by rationing (as in many nations). Motorists faced long lines at gas stations beginning in summer 1972 and increasing by summer 1973.", "BSkyB's electronic service was formally introduced on 1 October 1998 under the name Sky Digital, although minor-scale trials were conducted before then. At this time the use of the Sky Digital brand made a significant difference between the new service and Sky's analog services. Key selling points were the enhancement in image and audio quality, increased number of channels and an interactive service branded Open.... now called Sky Active, BSkyB competed with the ONdigital (later ITV Digital) terrestrial offering and cable services. Within 30 days, over 100,000 digiboxes had been sold, which helped bolstered BSkyB's decision to give away free digiboxes and minidishes from May 1999.", "Following the Nice Accord, there was an attempt to reform the constitutional legislation of the European Union and make it more transparent; this would have also produced a single constitutional document. However, as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands, the 2004 Accord establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force. Instead, the Lisbon Accord was enacted. Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional accord, but 'it significantly altered the existing treaties' did not completely supersede them.", "The juridical branch of the EU has played a significant role in the evolution of EU law, by assuming the function of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the primary juridical body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public significance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is \"to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate. Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments, including Van Gend en Loos, Mangold v Helm, and Kadi v Commission.", "Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa [var\u02c8\u0282ava] ( listen); see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland. It stands on the Vistula River in east-central Poland, roughly 260 kilometres (160 mi) from the Baltic Sea and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from the Carpathian Mountains. Its population is estimated at 1.740 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city limits cover 516.9 square kilometres (199.6 sq mi), while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres (2,355.39 sq mi).", "Oxygen condenses at 90.20 K (\u2212182.95 \u00b0C, \u2212297.31 \u00b0F), and freezes at 54.36 K (\u2212218.79 \u00b0C, \u2212361.82 \u00b0F). Both liquid and solid O2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid O2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air, using liquid nitrogen as a coolant. It is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.", "Charles Avison, the prominent British composer of concertos in the 18th century, was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1709 and passed away there in 1770. Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster, was born in the city in 1923. Vice Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood, was born in the city. Ironmaster, metallurgist, and member of parliament Isaac Lowthian Bell was born in the city in 1816. Other notable individuals born in or associated with Newcastle include: engineer and industrialist Lord Armstrong, engineer and father of the modern steam railways George Stephenson, his son, also an engineer, Robert Stephenson, engineer and inventor of the steam turbine Sir Charles Parsons, inventor of the incandescent light bulb Sir Joseph Swan, modernist poet Basil Bunting, and Lord Chief Justice Peter Taylor.

Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements. Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive administrative hurdles in purchasing property and constructing, In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to construct on government land. Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to authenticate transaction documents or having documents authenticated but failing to have them recorded with the official agency.", "Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed. In favorable circumstances, ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day. Only 100\u2013150 species have been validated, and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named. The textbook examples are cydippids with egg-shaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla (\"little tentacles\") that are covered with colloblasts, sticky cells that capture prey. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as dentition. These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area, because they specialize in different types of prey, which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.", "Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be transformed to another without providing any extra processing capability. The duration and memory usage of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.", "Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins. Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes (around 17 nm vs 25 nm). They take mRNAs transcribed from the chloroplast DNA and translate them into protein. While similar to bacterial ribosomes, chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria, so chloroplast ribosomes include some chloroplast-unique features. Small subunit ribosomal RNAs in several Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts lack motifs for shine-dalgarno sequence recognition, which is considered essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes. Such loss is also rarely observed in other plastids and prokaryotes.", "Always in search of new programs that would help it compete with NBC and CBS, ABC's management believed that sports could be a major catalyst in improving the network's market share. On April 29, 1961, ABC debuted Wide World of Sports, an anthology series created by Edgar Scherick through his company Sports Programs, Inc. and produced by a young Roone Arledge which featured a different sporting event each broadcast. ABC acquired Sports Programs, Inc. in exchange for shares in the company, leading it to become the future core of ABC Sports, with Arledge as the executive producer of that division's shows. Wide World of Sports, in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events.", "Luther's songs were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the song \"Ein neues Lied wir heben an\" (\"A new song we raise\"), which is generally known in English by John C. Messenger's translation by the title and first line \"Flung to the Heedless Winds\" and sung to the tune Ibstone composed in 1875 by Maria C. Tiddeman.", "Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use, various firms are investigating or utilizing the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines. The firm Energiprojekt AB in Sweden has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam. The effectiveness of Energiprojekt's steam engine reaches some 27-30% on high-pressure engines. It is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine (no compound) with superheated steam and consumes approx. 4 kg (8.8 lb) of steam per kWh.[not in citation given]", "Most species are hermaphrodites\u2014a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form. In at least some species, juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.", "The LOR method had the benefit of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a \"lifeboat\" in the event of a failure of the command ship. Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. A 1964 MSC study concluded, \"The LM [as lifeboat] ... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the SPS.\" Ironically, just such a failure happened on Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power. The Lunar Module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely.", "In response to demands for a German liturgy, Luther wrote a German ceremony, which he published in early 1526. He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin ceremony but as an alternative for the \"simple people\", a \"public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians.\" Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted \"everything that smacks of sacrifice\"; and the ceremony became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread. He retained the elevation of the host and chalice, while trappings such as the ceremony vestments, altar, and candles were made optional, allowing freedom of ceremony. Some reformers, including followers of Huldrych Zwingli, considered Luther's service too papistic; and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic ceremony. Luther's service, however, included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German, as well as of parts of the liturgy, including Luther's unison setting of the Creed. To reach the \"simple people\" and the young, Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism. He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.", "None of the original agreements establishing the European Union mention safeguarding for basic freedoms. It was not anticipated for European Union measures, that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions, to be subject to civil liberties. At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from infringing civil liberties, hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights. The European Court of Justice recognised basic freedoms as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the civil liberties enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent. In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of basic freedoms from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties.", "In 1962, visual designer Paul Rand revamped the ABC logo into its most recognizable (and current) form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's advertisements at the start of the 1963\u201364 season. The letters are strongly evocative of the Bauhaus font designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to revamp and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics).", "Engineering News-Record (ENR) is a trade magazine for the construction industry. Each year, ENR compiles and reports on information about the size of design and construction companies. They publish a list of the largest companies in the United States (Top-40) and also a list the largest global firms (Top-250, by amount of work they are doing outside their home country). In 2014, ENR compiled the information in nine market segments. It was divided as transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing, sewer/waste, telecom, hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects. In their reporting on the Top 400, they used information on transportation, sewer, hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors.", "Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, are based on large prime numbers (for example, 512-bit primes are frequently used for RSA and 1024-bit primes are typical for Diffie\u2013Hellman.). RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.", "The Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s Terminology and Visuals Department was under the same strain being felt in repositories around the globe, to digitalize their compilation. A large scale digitalization initiative commenced in 2007 in that department. That initiative was entitled the Factory Initiative to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitalize the compilation. The first step of the Factory Initiative was to take snapshots utilizing digital cameras. The Terminology and Visuals Department had a compilation of old snapshots but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new snapshots were shot. Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers on the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. 15,000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Initiative, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. The second stage of the Factory Initiative is to catalog everything. The third stage of the Factory Initiative is to audit the compilation. All of those items which were photographed and cataloged, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the compilation was physically found during the creation of the Factory Initiative. The fourth goal of the Factory Initiative is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. There is a \"Search the Collections\" feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. The main impetus behind the large-scale digitalization initiative called the Factory Initiative was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.", "Every May since 1987, the University of Chicago has held the University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt, in which large teams of students compete to obtain notoriously esoteric items from a list.

The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'o\u00efl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the regional language that survives today.", "Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds (notably oxides) with most elements. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. However, monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend, because of fossil-fuel burning. Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide, making up almost half of the crust's mass.", "The Lobata have a pair of lobes, which are muscular, cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side of the mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.", "Jochi passed away in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Some academics, notably Ratchnevsky, have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan. Rashid al-Din reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223, and while his brothers heeded the order, Jochi remained in Khorasan. Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench. Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction, as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief. He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi: \"Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands. I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting, made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad, brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Islamic followers.\" Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned; however, as Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223, the accuracy of this story is questionable.", "CBS transmitted Super Bowl 50 in the U.S., and charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game.

Marine species need to be resilient enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three marine genera \u2013 Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.", "The service commenced on 1 September 1993 based on the concept from the then principal executive, Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch, of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package. Within two months of the launch, BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994.

Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300\u2013600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.", "Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income, market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration, which may better be explained by the non-market force known as \"rent-seeking\". While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation, greater productivity, etc., it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices, profits and large compensation. A better explainer of growing inequality, according to Stiglitz, is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies economically advantageous to them. This process, known to economists as rent-seeking, brings income not from creation of wealth but from \"grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort\"", "The Yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native Chinese people ruled all of China. In the historiography of Mongolia, it is generally considered to be the continuation of the Mongol Empire. Mongolians are widely known to reverence the Eternal Heaven, and according to the traditional Mongolian ideology Yuan is considered to be \"the beginning of an infinite number of beings, the foundation of peace and happiness, state power, the dream of many peoples, besides it there is nothing great or precious.\" In traditional historiography of China, on the other hand, the Yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the Song dynasty and the Ming dynasty. Note, however, Yuan dynasty is traditionally often extended to cover the Mongol Empire before Kublai Khan's formal establishment of the Yuan in 1271, partly because Kublai had his grandfather Genghis Khan placed on the official record as the founder of the dynasty or Taizu (Chinese: \u592a\u7956). Despite the traditional historiography as well as the official views (including the government of the Ming dynasty which overthrew the Yuan dynasty), there also exist Chinese people[who?] who did not consider the Yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of China, but rather as a period of foreign domination. The latter believe that Han Chinese were treated as second-class citizens,[citation needed] and that China stagnated economically and scientifically.", "Revitalized sectarian conflict in the 1620s led to the political and military rights of the Huguenots being annulled after their loss. They maintained the religious clauses of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV, who gradually intensified harassment of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau (1685), which annulled all legal acknowledgment of Protestantism in France, and compelled the Huguenots to convert. While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed  or submitted, roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century[citation needed].", "Today, Warsaw has some of the top healthcare establishments in Poland and East-Central Europe.

The infrastructure has developed a lot over the past years.", "At the core of academics' discussion about Luther's impact is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial anti-Semitism of the Nazis. Some academics see Luther's impact as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Hebrews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's compositions against the Hebrews were largely disregarded in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi anti-Semitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written. His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.\"", "The final years of the Yuan dynasty were marked by turmoil, famine, and resentment among the population. In time, Kublai Khan's successors lost all influence on other Mongol lands across Asia, while the Mongols beyond the Middle Kingdom saw them as too Chinese. Gradually, they lost influence in China as well. The reigns of the later Yuan rulers were short and marked by intrigues and rivalries. Uninterested in administration, they were separated from both the military and the population, and China was torn by dissension and unrest. Outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening Yuan forces.", "The poll produced a majority SNP administration, making this the first time in the Scottish Parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority. The SNP took 16 seats from Labour, with many of their key figures not returned to parliament, although Labour leader Iain Gray retained East Lothian by 151 votes. The SNP took a further eight seats from the Liberal Democrats and one seat from the Conservatives. The SNP overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the Scottish Parliament to hold a plebiscite on Scottish independence.", "Originating as the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad in 1999, it pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2004, participated in the Iraqi rebellion that followed the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western troops, joined the fight in the Syrian Civil War beginning in March 2011, and was expelled from al-Qaeda in early 2014, (which complained of its failure to consult and \"notorious intransigence\"). The group gained prominence after it drove Iraqi government troops out of key cities in western Iraq in a 2014 offensive. The group is adept at social media, posting Internet videos of beheadings of soldiers, civilians, journalists and aid workers, and is known for its destruction of cultural heritage sites. The United Nations has held ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a \"historic scale\". The group has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the European Union and member states, the United States, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other countries.", "Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally constituting 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly as a result of bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.", "The galleries also connect design to broader trends in British culture. For instance, design in the Tudor period was influenced by the dissemination of printed books and the work of European artists and craftsmen employed in Britain. In the Stuart period, growing trade, especially with Asia, enabled wider access to luxuries like carpets, lacquered furniture, silks and porcelain. In the Georgian age there was increasing emphasis on entertainment and leisure. For example, the increase in tea drinking led to the production of tea paraphernalia such as china and caddies. European styles seen on the Grand Tour also influenced taste. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the growth of mass production produced entrepreneurs such as Josiah Wedgwood, Matthew Boulton and Eleanor Coade. In the Victorian era new technology and machinery had a significant effect on manufacturing, and for the first time since the reformation, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches had a major effect on art and design such as the Gothic Revival. There is a large display on the Great Exhibition which, among other things, led to the founding of the V&A. In the later 19th century, the increasing backlash against industrialization, led by John Ruskin, contributed to the Arts and Crafts movement.", "The emergency reduced the demand for big cars. Japanese imports, primarily the Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla, the Datsun B210, the Datsun 510, the Honda Civic, the Mitsubishi Galant (a captive import from Chrysler sold as the Dodge Colt), the Subaru DL, and later the Honda Accord all had four cylinder motors that were more fuel efficient than the typical American V8 and six cylinder engines. Japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive, which became de facto standards.", "Justifying Grace or Accepting Grace is that mercy, offered by God to all individuals, that we obtain by confidence and reliance in Christ, through which God pardons the believer of sin. It is in Justifying Grace we are received by God, in spite of our sin. In this reception, we are forgiven through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ on the cross. The justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love God and neighbor. Today, justifying grace is also known as conversion, \"accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior,\" or being \"born again\". John Wesley originally called this experience the New Birth. This experience can occur in different ways; it can be one transforming moment, such as an altar call experience, or it may involve a series of decisions across a period of time.", "Telenet was the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. It was founded by former ARPA IPTO director Larry Roberts as a means of making ARPANET technology public. He had tried to interest AT&T in buying the technology, but the monopoly's reaction was that this was incompatible with their future. Bolt, Beranack and Newman (BBN) provided the financing. It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X.25 and the terminal interface to X.29. Telenet designed these protocols and helped standardize them in the CCITT. Telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975. It went public in 1979 and was then sold to GTE", "Some forms of civil noncompliance, such as unlawful boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft evasion, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function.

Their presence, combined with a perceived British policy of allowing them free rein, heightened by expos\u00e9s such as the 2007 Channel 4 documentary programme Undercover Mosque, has given rise to the term Londonistan. Following the 9/11 attacks, however, Abu Hamza al-Masri, the imam of the Finsbury Park Mosque, was apprehended and charged with incitement to terrorism which has caused many Islamists to leave the UK to avoid internment.[citation needed]", "The Broncos took an early advantage in Super Bowl 50 and never trailed.

Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP, recording five solo tackles, 2\u00bd sacks, and two forced fumbles.", "The vegetation of the city may be considered very rich in species. The species richness is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas (natural woodlands, wetlands along the Vistula) as well as arable land, meadows and woodlands. Bielany Forest, located within the borders of Warsaw, is the remaining part of the Masovian Primeval Forest. Bielany Forest nature reserve is connected with Kampinos Forest. It is home to rich fauna and flora. Within the forest there are three cycling and walking trails. Other big woodland area is Kabaty Forest by the southern city border.

Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1. Although (as series co-star Sophie Aldred reported in the documentary Doctor Who: More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS) it was effectively, if not formally, cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th series of the show for transmission in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed that the series would return.", "While in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart wed Berengaria of Navarre, first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. The nuptials were held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily. The matrimony was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned King of Cyprus, and Berengaria Queen of England and Queen of Cyprus as well.", "The term \u2018empire\u2019 comes from the Latin term imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be \u2018sovereignty\u2019, or simply \u2018rule\u2019\u201d. The greatest differentiation of an empire is through the quantity of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political authority grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.", "While most online pharmacies sell prescription medications and require a valid prescription, some online pharmacies sell prescription medications without requiring a prescription. Many clients order medications from such pharmacies avoid the \"inconvenience\" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.", "In 1888, the editor of Electrical World magazine, Thomas Commerford Martin (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE). Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system \u2014 something for which Westinghouse had been trying to secure patents. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor presented in a paper in March 1888 by the Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided Tesla's patent would probably control the market.", "Jacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from negative effects of rapid urban expansion after World War II. The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the outskirts. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, the development of outskirts and a subsequent wave of middle class \"white flight\" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, declined from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.", "The Amazon jungle (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Amazonia; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a humid deciduous forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the jungle. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the jungle, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining jungles, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical jungle in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.", "Almost all ctenophores are carnivores \u2013 there are no herbivores and only one genus that is partly parasitic. If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day. While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey \u2013 some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled \"cydippid\" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.", "In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998. They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) techniques for Y. pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, \". . . ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages\".", "On Carolina's next possession fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy tipped a Manning pass to himself and then intercepted it, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 1:55 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line. But with 11 seconds left, Newton was sacked by DeMarcus Ware as time expired in the half.", "In early 2012, NFL Chief Roger Goodell stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl \"spectacular\" and that it would be \"an important game for us as a league\".", "The smaller exhibitions cover Korea, the Himalayan kingdoms and South East Asia.

This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such powers act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.", "Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post districts and are known as \"District MSPs\". Electors select one member to represent the district, and the member with most votes is returned as a district MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament districts shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament districts in Scotland, prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own district MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament district comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in districts of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger district areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. If a District MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her district, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.", "Many counties offer alternative certification programs to attract individuals into education, especially for hard-to-fill positions.

Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field, a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry. Such ramification questions occur even in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers. For example, prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity, a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations", "The overall number of positions in the Legislature are allocated to gatherings proportionally to the number of ballots received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is granted the first list position, the number of list ballots cast for each gathering is divided by one plus the number of positions the gathering won in the region (at this point just constituency positions). The gathering with the highest quotient is granted the position, which is then added to its constituency positions in allocating the second position. This is repeated iteratively until all available list positions are allocated.", "On the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was unintentionally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of vessels, and has been blamed for causing sharp declines in fish catches by consuming both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal \u2013 and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the unintentional introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.", "Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense,\" and opposed religious zealotry. Despite this, he had a profound admiration for both Buddhism and Christianity.", "By 1954, all U.S. networks had regained control of their programming, with higher advertising revenues: ABC's revenue increased by 67% (earning $26 million), NBC's went up by 30% ($100 million) and CBS's rose by 44% ($117 million). However that year, ABC had only 14 principal associates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network associates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.", "A procedural consequence of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament is that Scottish MPs sitting in the UK House of Commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to England, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 whilst English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Westminster MPs are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the Scottish Parliament. This phenomenon is known as the West Lothian question and has led to criticism.

Following the acquisition of California by the United States, the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro-slavery politicians to arrange the division of Alta California at 36 degrees, 30 minutes, the line of the Missouri Compromise. Instead, the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state, preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state.", "Prior to European colonization, the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of Aboriginal peoples, collectively known as the Koori. With Great Britain having claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788, Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales. The first establishment in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales. Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self-rule in 1855. The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia. Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927, with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne.", "The United Methodist Church upholds the sanctity of human existence both of the child and the mother.

Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. During gestation, a particular type of antibody, called IgG, is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta, so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother. Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies\u2014it only borrows them. This passive immunity is usually short-term, lasting from a few days up to several months. In medicine, protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich serum.", "Methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure (e.g., \"St. James UMC\").

However, there are some in The United Methodist Church who feel that false interfaith cooperation might result in the \"blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity.\"", "Kinetic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a vessel moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the vessel moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the vessel despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.", "In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.

These instructors do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course subjects on a daily basis.

Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only appropriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmacies also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) derives from pharmakon (\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd), meaning \"drug\", \"medicine\" (or \"poison\").[n 1]", "Following the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the more humid weather may have permitted the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent. From 66\u201334 Mya, the rainforest extended as far south as 45\u00b0. Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics. During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species.", "Despite their delicate, jelly-like bodies, fossils believed to represent ctenophores, apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than contemporary forms, have been discovered in lagerst\u00e4tten as far back as the early Cambrian, about 515 million years ago. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been disputed, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all contemporary ctenophores was cydippid-like, and that all the contemporary groups emerged relatively recently, probably after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.", "The CYCLADES packet switching system was a French research system designed and directed by Louis Pouzin. Initially demonstrated in 1973, it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support system research generally. It was the initial system to make the nodes responsible for reliable delivery of data, rather than the system itself, using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms. Concepts of this system influenced later ARPANET architecture.", "Southern California consists of one of the more diverse collections of geological, topographical, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a variety outnumbering other major regions in the state and country. The region spans from Pacific Ocean islands, coastlines, shores, and coastal plains, through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges with their summits, into the large and small interior valleys, to the vast deserts of California.", "Concerns were raised over whether Levi's Stadium's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to be re-turfed multiple times due to various issues, and during a week 6 game earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-turfed the field with a new playing surface; a hybrid Bermuda 419 turf. NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in \"great shape\" for gameday. However, the turf showed problem throughout the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and player slipping during plays all throughout the game.", "Tem\u00fcjin began his rise to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a vassal) to his father's anda (sworn brother or blood brother) Toghrul, who was Khan of the Keraites, and is better known by the Chinese title \"Wang Khan\", which the Jurchen Jin dynasty granted him in 1197. This relationship was first reinforced when B\u00f6rte was seized by the Merkits. Tem\u00fcjin turned to Toghrul for support, and in response, Toghrul offered his vassal 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that he also involve his childhood friend Jamukha, who had himself become Khan (ruler) of his own tribe, the Jadaran.", "In many regions of the United States, after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka that demanded United States schools desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\", local families organized a wave of private \"Christian academies\". In much of the U.S. South, many white students migrated to the academies, while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students (see List of private schools in Mississippi). The academic content of the academies was usually College Preparatory. Since the 1970s, many of these \"segregation academies\" have shut down, although some continue to operate.[citation needed]", "The Melodic Devices exhibition closed 25 February 2010, a decision which was highly contentious. An online petition of over 5,100 names on the Parliamentary website led to Chris Smith asking Parliament about the future of the assemblage. The answer, from Bryan Davies was that the repository intended to conserve and tend for the assemblage and keep it available to the public, with artifacts being redistributed to the British Exhibitions, the Medieval & Renaissance Exhibitions, and the planned new exhibitions for Furnishings and Europe 1600\u20131800, and that the Horniman Museum and other institutions were possible candidates for borrowings of material to ensure that the instruments remained publicly viewable. The Horniman went on to host a joint exhibition with the V&A of melodic devices, and has the loan of 35 instruments from the repository.", "Alternative schools are ordinary primary or secondary schools, which are run by private individuals, private organizations or religious groups. These schools offer the same types of diplomas as public schools. Alternative schools lack the freedom to operate completely outside of government regulation. Educators at Alternative schools must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as educators at public schools, an Alternative school must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents (the so-called Sonderungsverbot). Therefore, most Alternative schools have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships, compared to most other Western European countries. However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees, which is why all German Alternative schools are additionally financed with public funds. The percentages of public money could reach 100% of the personnel expenditures. Nevertheless, Independent Schools became insolvent in the past in Germany.", "Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice. Materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used (e.g. brick versus stone, versus timber). Cost of construction on a per square meter (or per square foot) basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions, local regulations, economies of scale (custom designed homes are often more expensive to build) and the availability of skilled tradespeople. As residential construction (as well as all other types of construction) can generate a lot of waste, careful planning again is needed here.", "A revamped edition of the ABC logo was unveiled for publicity for the 2013\u201314 season during the network's upfront presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially unveiled on-air on June 17 (although some affiliates implemented the novel design prior to then), as part of a makeover of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar. The updated logo carries a simpler sheen design than the previous edition, and contains lettering more closely resembling Paul Rand's original version of the circle logo. The logo is displayed on-air, online and in print commercials in four variants shading the respective color used with the circle design's native black coloring: a gold version is primarily used on entertainment-oriented outlets (such as ABC.com, WATCH ABC, and by ABC Studios) and the on-screen bug; steel blue and dark grey versions are used primarily by ABC News; a red version is used for ESPN on ABC, while all four variants are used selectively in commercials and by affiliates. A new custom font, \"ABC Modern\" (which was inspired by the logotype), was also created for use in commercials and other promotional materials.", "An example of a decision problem is the following.

The present Prime Minister of Victoria is Daniel Andrews.", "On September 3, 1958, the Disneyland anthology series was renamed Walt Disney Presents as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name. The trend in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well. ABC requested additional productions from Disney. In late 1958, Desilu Productions pitched its detective series The Untouchables to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show, and debuted The Untouchables in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become \"extremely popular\".", "In 1523, Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ. However, as the Reformation continued, Luther began to lose hope in large-scale Jewish conversion to Christianity. In his later years, Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews, writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists, Zwinglianism, and the papacy. His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren L\u00fcgen (On the Jews and Their Lies) took its place among other anti-Jewish literature of the times, although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme, even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe. In it, he takes a hardline against Judaism, writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed, their money confiscated, and liberty curtailed. These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status.", "The blockade was not uniform across Europe. Of the nine members of the European Economic Community (EEC), the Netherlands encountered a total blockade, the UK and France received almost uninterrupted shipments (having refused to allow America to use their airfields and blocked arms and shipments to both the Arabs and the Israelis), while the other six faced partial reductions. The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel, and Harold Wilson's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War. His successor, Ted Heath, reversed this policy in 1970, calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders.", "In addition, there are $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a brew, liquor and cuisine festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally.

There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, Turkish hazel and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The \u0141azienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.", "The 2007 Lisbon Accord explicitly acknowledged basic rights by providing in Article 6(1) that \"The Union acknowledges the rights, liberties and principles set out in the Charter of Basic Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000, as adopted at Strasbourg on 12 December 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the Accords.\" Therefore, the Charter of Basic Rights of the European Union has become an integral part of European Union law, codifying the basic rights which were previously considered general principles of European Union law. In effect, after the Lisbon Accord, the Charter and the Convention now co-exist under European Union law, though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice in relation to European Union measures, and the latter by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to measures by member states.", "In December 1878, Tesla departed Graz and terminated all connections with his family to conceal the fact that he withdrew from school. His friends thought that he had perished in the Mur River. Tesla went to Maribor (now in Slovenia), where he worked as a designer for 60 florins a month. He spent his leisure time playing cards with local men on the streets. In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused. Nikola suffered a mental collapse at around the same time.", "As of 2012, high-quality independent schools in the United States charged significant fees, close to $40,000 yearly for daytime educational institutions in New York City, and nearly $50,000 for residential schools. However, fees did not cover operational expenses, particularly at residential schools. The prominent schools such as the Groton School had significant endowments running to hundreds of millions of dollars supplemented by fundraising campaigns. Residential schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the country, indeed the globe, and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity.", "Educators that exhibit eagerness can lead to pupils who are more likely to be engaged, interested, energetic, and curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between teacher eagerness and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom. Controlled, experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of eagerness, such as demonstrative gesturing, dramatic movements which are varied, and emotional facial expressions, result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.", "Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytic cells in tissues that are in proximity to the external environment; therefore, they are situated mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but Dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.", "This was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the #1 selection of the 1998 NFL draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver. Manning and Newton also set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).", "The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne (popularly known as the 'Lit & Phil') is the largest independent repository outside London, housing more than 150,000 volumes.

Operating since 1793 and founded as a \u2018conversation club,\u2019 its lecture theatre was the first public building to be lit by electric light, during a lecture by Joseph Swan on 20 October 1880.", "One hypothesis is that, while noncompliance may be beneficial, any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. It has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.", "Johnson's campaign was better planned than Shirley's, which was noticed by New France's administrator, the Marquis de Vaudreuil. He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio, and had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley's expected attack. When Johnson was seen as the larger threat, Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to meet that threat. Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fortified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. The battle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field. Johnson's advance stopped at Fort William Henry, and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point, where they began the construction of Fort Carillon (later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759).", "Between the 1880s and World War II, Central Fresno flourished, filled with electric Street Cars, and contained some of the San Joaquin Valley's most beautiful architectural buildings.

Each granule can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoid membranes, though grana with 10\u201320 thylakoid membranes are most common. Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoid membranes, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoid membranes. The helices ascend at an angle of 20\u201325\u00b0, connecting to each granular thylakoid membrane at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While different parts of the thylakoid membrane system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.", "Harvard has the largest university fund in the world. As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $28 billion in September 2010 and $26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of the Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement.", "In front of the Presiding Officers' desk is the parliamentary sceptre, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around the head of the sceptre, which has a formal ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, reinforcing the authority of the Parliament in its ability to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon its official opening in July 1999, the sceptre is displayed in a glass case suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the sceptre is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.", "Considerable minorities of other creeds do exist (Islamic 11.2%, native beliefs 1.7%), and nonreligious 2.4%.

Geographically, California's north-south midway point lies at exactly 37\u00b0 9' 58.23\" latitude, around 11 miles (18 km) south of San Jose; however, this does not coincide with popular use of the term. When the state is divided into two areas (northern and meridional California), the term \"meridional California\" usually refers to the ten meridional-most counties of the state. This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35\u00b0 47\u2032 28\u2033 north latitude, which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties. Another definition for meridional California uses Point Conception and the Tehachapi Mountains as the northern boundary.", "The Emperor's military was split by varied internal conflicts and by the Emperor's decision to divide his military into small units concentrated in various towns. This disintegration was decisive in Khwarezmia's losses, as it allowed the Mongols, although drained from the long voyage, to immediately set about defeating small portions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified resistance. The Mongol military quickly seized the town of Otrar, relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale slaughter of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions. Near the end of the battle the Emperor fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan ordered Subutai and Jebe to hunt him down, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this. The Emperor died under mysterious circumstances on a small island within his empire.", "In a purely capitalist mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of employees) the employees' compensation will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Compensation operates in the same way as prices for any other good. Thus, compensation can be considered as a function of market price of expertise. And therefore, disparity is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of expertise is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled employee and the supply of the skilled employee. \"On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and exploit employees and consumers.\" \"Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of disparity, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.\" Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their company is chronically understaffed. Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to employees.", "This motivates the concept of an issue being challenging for a complexity class. An issue X is challenging for a class of issues C if every issue in C can be reduced to X. Thus no issue in C is more challenging than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any issue in C. Of course, the notion of challenging issues depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of issues that are challenging for NP is the set of NP-hard issues.", "Since the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a multitude of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and even stage performances. In this respect it is noteworthy that the BBC takes no position on the authenticity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed aversion for the idea.", "In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide (HgO) inside a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.", "Tribunals have differentiated between two types of civic noncompliance: \"Indirect civic noncompliance involves violating a legislation which is not, itself, the object of demonstration, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular legislation by breaking that legislation.\" During the Vietnam War, tribunals typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of unlawful demonstrations from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legitimacy of the Vietnam War; the tribunals ruled it was a political question. The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civic noncompliants to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the tribunal. However, tribunal cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 unlawful occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside tribunals despite admonitions not to; according to FIJA, many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\"", "For many geologic applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges, and paleotopography.", "Luther's songs were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the anthem \"Ein neues Lied wir heben an\" (\"A new song we raise\"), which is generally known in English by John C.

Many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by Miller-Boyett Productions, a Warner Bros.-based studio that briefly programmed the entire Friday lineup during the 1990\u201391 season (with Going Places joining Family Matters, Full House and Perfect Strangers on the \"TGIF\" schedule) and through its development deal with Paramount Television prior to 1986 (as Miller-Milkis, and later, Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions), had earlier produced Happy Days and its various spinoffs among other series for the network.", "Land-based steam engines could discharge much of their steam, as feed water was usually readily accessible. Prior to and during World War I, the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel velocity was not essential. It was however superseded by the British invention steam turbine where velocity was required, for instance in warships, such as the dreadnought battleships, and ocean liners. HMS Dreadnought of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.[citation needed]", "In the 1970s, the metropolis was the subject of a melody, \"Walking Into Fresno\", written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the world-famous \"WWVA Jamboree\" radio and television program in Wheeling, West Virginia. Aken, adopted by Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga, grew up in the neighboring town of Madera and his melody chronicled the hardships faced by the migrant farm workers he saw as a child. Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.", "Demographically, it was the most varied metropolis in Poland, with significant numbers of foreign-born residents. In addition to the Polish majority, there was a significant Jewish minority in Warsaw. According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 638,000, Jews constituted 219,000 (around 34% percent). Warsaw's prewar Jewish population of more than 350,000 constituted about 30 percent of the city's total population. In 1933, out of 1,178,914 inhabitants 833,500 were of Polish mother tongue. World War II changed the demographics of the city, and to this day there is much less ethnic diversity than in the previous 300 years of Warsaw's history. Most of the modern day population growth is based on internal migration and urbanisation.", "Throughout the ages, the Kenyan Coast has played host to many traders and travelers. Among the towns that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi. It has remained a significant Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled Mombasa for supremacy in the African Great Lakes region. Malindi has traditionally been a hospitable port city for foreign powers. In 1414, the Chinese trader and traveler Zheng He representing the Ming Dynasty visited the East African coast on one of his last 'treasure voyages'. Malindi authorities welcomed the Portuguese traveler Vasco da Gama in 1498.", "The Chief Minister of Victoria is the leader of the political party or coalition with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Chief Minister is the public face of government and, with cabinet, sets the legislative and political agenda. Cabinet consists of representatives elected to either house of parliament. It is responsible for managing areas of government that are not exclusively the Commonwealth's, by the Australian Constitution, such as education, health and law enforcement. The current Chief Minister of Victoria is Daniel Andrews.", "The Command Module (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield, and had its own reaction control system (RCS) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path. Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown. The module was 11.42 feet (3.48 m) tall, 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter, and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds (5,560 kg).", "Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional stalemate in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, clash. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be Civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.", "Datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the Dutch PTT Telecom (now known as KPN). Rigorously speaking Datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines (using the X.121 DNIC 2041), the name also referred to the public PAD service Telepad (using the DNIC 2049). And because the main Videotex service used the network and modified PAD devices as infrastructure the name Datanet 1 was used for these services as well. Although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of KPN contributed to the confusion.", "The resistant mechanism protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the inherent immune mechanism provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Inherent immune mechanisms are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the inherent response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the inherent response. Here, the resistant mechanism adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.", "According to Sheldon Ungar's comparison with global warming, the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties. The ozone case communicated to lay persons \"with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture\" and related to \"immediate risks with everyday relevance\", while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger. The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts. In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol, varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem. In the UK, a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change.", "Some disagree with such double or triple non-French linguistic origins, arguing that for the word to have spread into common use in France, it must have originated in the French language. The \"Hugues hypothesis\" argues that the name was derived by association with Hugues Capet, king of France, who reigned long before the Reformation. He was regarded by the Gallicans and Protestants as a noble man who respected people's dignity and lives. Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo.", "In 1893 Richard Dean Adams, who led the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company sought Tesla's viewpoint on what system would be optimal to transmit energy generated at the falls. Over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to utilize energy generated by the falls with many systems being proposed by several US and European companies including two-phase and three-phase alternating current, high-voltage direct current, and even compressed air. Adams queried Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse Electric system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. Based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse Electric's demonstration that they could build a complete alternating current system at the Columbian Exposition, a contract for building a two-phase alternating current generating system at the Niagara Falls was awarded to Westinghouse Electric. A further contract to build the alternating current distribution network was awarded to General Electric.", "In southern Europe, the scene was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP (million years before present). The current Mediterranean Sea originates from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.", "CBS transmitted Super Bowl 50 in the U.S., and charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second advertisement during the game. The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was fronted by the British rock group Coldplay with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars, who directed the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively. It was the third-most viewed U.S. broadcast ever.", "In 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's establishment, ID sequences had the emblem appear in a gold CGI design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan \"That Special Feeling\" in a script font. Ten years later, in 1993, the \"ABC Circle\" emblem reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle. The ABC emblem first appeared as a on-screen bug in the 1993\u201394 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the 1995\u201396 season; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011\u201312 season.", "In World War II, it was acknowledged that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies. The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, A Bridge Too Far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944. The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact \u2013 much to their own surprise \u2013 after the Germans failed to demolish it. This also became the subject of a film, The Bridge at Remagen. Seven Days to the River Rhine was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War.", "There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC. There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes, that is to say, the statistical behaviour of primes in the large, can be modelled. The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the likelihood that a given, randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, or to the logarithm of n.", "Chemical barriers also protect against infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the \u03b2-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal discharge serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.", "Manning concluded the contest 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception and zero touchdowns. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson was the game's leading runner with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), 2\u00bd sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all four of his field goals, making him perfect on all 11 attempts during the post-season. Newton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards, with one interception. He was also the team's leading runner with 45 yards on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions for 74. Ealy was the top defensive performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive End Charles Johnson had four total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total tackles, while Thomas Davis had seven, despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.", "After a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol, an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates, or adds a phosphate group to many (but not all) of them in their transit sequences. Phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide, keeping it from folding prematurely. This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place\u2014the cytosol. At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast. These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast.", "Six of the seven routes of the commuter rail system, Metrolink, run out of Downtown Los Angeles, connecting Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, and San Diego counties with the other route connecting San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties directly.", "The concept \"power\" keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics, though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the mechanics is now described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation instead of Newtonian equations. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes \"quantized\", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of \"powers\". However, the potentials V(x,y,z) or fields, from which the powers generally can be derived, are treated similar to classical position variables, i.e., .", "Tesla obtained around 300 licenses worldwide for his creations.

Many of Tesla's licenses were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other licenses were approved in countries around the globe.:62 Many creations developed by Tesla were not put into license protection.", "In connectionless mode every datagram contains complete addressing information. The datagrams are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Every datagram is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the datagram. This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the datagram find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the datagram header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Every datagram is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every datagram as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the datagram sequence number. Thus a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol, although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service.", "Plastids can serve as cellular detectors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, plastids begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the plastid, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling\u2014signals from the plastid that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.", "In 2014, work was completed on the stations historic entrance. Glazing was placed over the historic arches and the Victorian architecture was enhanced; transforming the 19th century public portico. The station is one of only six Grade One listed railway stations in the UK. Opened in 1850 by Queen Victoria, it was the first covered railway station in the world and was much copied across the UK. It has a neoclassical fa\u00e7ade, originally designed by the architect John Dobson, and was constructed in collaboration with Robert Stephenson. The station sightlines towards the Castle Keep, whilst showcasing the curvature of the station\u2019s arched roof. The first services were operated by the North Eastern Railway company.

The conflict was clashed between the colonies of British America and New France, with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France, as well as Native American allies. At the start of the conflict, the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 European settlers, compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies. The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians. Long in conflict, the metropole nations declared conflict on each other in 1756, escalating the conflict from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict.", "Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements.

The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it.

This is more than just \"foreign\" music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture altering their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of luxurious American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War altered the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea. The importance of subtle influence is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.", "After the establishment of the settlement of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern portion named New South Wales and a western portion named New Holland, under the management of the colonial authority in Sydney.
