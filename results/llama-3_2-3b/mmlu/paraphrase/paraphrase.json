In this case, we are looking for the order of the element (4, 2) in the group Z_12 x Z_8. \n\nTo find the order of (4, 2), we need to find the smallest positive integer m such that (4, 2)^m = (0, 0).

We can use a z-table or calculator to find the corresponding z-scores.\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nFor the area to the left of 3 years: 0.6 = \u03a6(z)\nz \u2248 0.2533\n\nFor the area to the left of 6 years: 0.7 = \u03a6(z)\nz \u2248 0.5244\n\nNow, we can use the symmetry of the normal distribution to find the mean. Since the area to the left of 3 years is 0.6, the area to the right of 3 years is 0.4. Similarly, the area to the left of 6 years is 0.7, so the area to the right of 6 years is 0.3.\n\nWe can set up the following equations:\n\n0.4 = \u03a6(z) + \u03a6(-z)\n0.3 = \u03a6(z) + \u03a6(-z)\n\nSince \u03a6(-z) = 1 - \u03a6(z), we can rewrite the equations as:\n\n0.4 = \u03a6(z) + 1 - \u03a6(z)\n0.3 = \u03a6(z) + \u03a6(z)\n\nSimplifying the equations, we get:\n\n0.4 = 1\n0.3 = 2\u03a6(z)\n\nSolving for \u03a6(z), we get:\n\n\u03a6(z) = 0.15\n\nNow, we can find the z-score corresponding to \u03a6(z) = 0.15:\n\nz \u2248 -1.036\n\nUsing the z-score formula, we can find the mean:\n\n\u03bc = z\u03c3\n-1.036 = -\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u2248 1.036\n\nNow, we can find the mean using one of the z-scores:\n\n\u03bc = z\u03c3\n0.2533 = -1.036\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u2248 1.036\n\u03bc \u2248 3.677\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA) \u03bc = 3.677, \u03c3 = 3.561", "C", "B) I and II", "A", "B", "A", "B", "B", "B", "B", "B", "A", "D", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "C", "D", "C", "C", "C", "B", "A", "A", "C", "B", "B", "A", "B", "C", "A", "C", "B", "B", "C", "C", "C", "D", "C", "B", "C", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "C", "C", "D", "C", "D", "D", "C", "A", "C", "A\nExplanation: To minimize the likelihood of a 12-ounce cup overflowing, we want to set the mean to the lowest possible value. This is equivalent to finding the z-score corresponding to the 0.01 probability (1 - 0.99) in the standard normal distribution. The z-score is given by z = -2.326. Therefore, the mean setting should be 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces.", "D", "C", "A", "D", "B", "A", "B", "D", "A", "A", "C", "D", "D", "A", "C", "D", "C", "B", "B", "C", "D", "A", "A", "D", "D", "D", "B", "A", "A\nB", "A", "C", "A", "C", "B", "C", "D", "A", "B", "A", "C", "B", "B", "A", "D", "C", "B", "C", "B", "A", "A", "A", "B", "C", "A", "C", "D", "C", "C", "D", "B", "D", "B", "D", "C", "A)", "C", "A", "C", "A) 0.5, 0.5, 0.2", "A", "C", "D", "D", "B", "A", "A", "D", "B", "A", "D", "A", "C", "D.
